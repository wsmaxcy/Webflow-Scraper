WEBFLOW-I-58,Multi-language sites and CMS fields,7374,Each page and CMS entry is translatable. When creating fields for a Collection mark whether that field is translatable (some fields won't need translation like references to other collections price fields etc).

WEBFLOW-I-3429,European Hosting to comply with GDPR,2844,I have several clients in Europe (germany and switzerland) and I love Webflow but they are all very concerned with data privacy and complying to GDPR. Especially now with the current privacy shield solutions. Please please work on an European hosting so you don't loose valuable customers. I see this issue popping up on so many webflow groups (facebook).  More and more freelancers as well as agencies are moving back to WordPress bc of that significant issue.,21/10/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3429

WEBFLOW-I-59,Real-time filtering/sorting on website (Faceted navigation),3915,It would be great to be able to easily create a robust portfolio with real-time filters. For example if you are a photographer then an image gallery with filter categories such as landscape portraits street photography etc... Upon clicking on the filter only the specific category items appear. This is very common with wordpress portfolio sites but its extremely difficult to set up in webflow.,18/01/2017,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-59

WEBFLOW-I-893,Ability to style CSS Combinators: combo classes pseudo classes nested classes,2640,When I add a css class and then add another css class on top of it the resulting css rule in the code is a compound rule. Most of the time this is fine but there are times I need the two rules to be separate. Please expand on the css layering by giving us granular options for creating single-class or compound rules and maybe even some complex bits like parent/sibling selectors or ":" suffix rules. Mainly if I've got two elements and one's got classes A->B->D while the other's got classes A->C->D I don't want to have to define D twice like I do now.,20/09/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-893
WEBFLOW-I-2614,Setting Up Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) Framework with Webflow Site.,1440,It is clear that majority of traffic websites receive come from mobile. According to Neil Patel an SEO Digital Marketer 58% of Google searches now happen on mobile. Websites today are not simply about great design rather it is about how much traffic that site is able to generate. The main reason why businesses want a website is because they feel that is is a great way for them to maximize online traffic which could ultimately maximize profit. Of course there are ways to optimize your content for mobile without the Google AMP Framework for example by reducing the amount and size of assets on mobile view-ports taking a mobile-first approach during design and implementing on-page SEO. Webflow also provides ways to enhance site performance with CDNs and Code Minification. However Google's AMP Framework actually helps ensure that your site is mobile friendly for users without any guessing work according to specific details Google finds to be of best practice. This is important because we want our and our clients' websites in mobile viewports to be completely optimized for Google's search engine. Furthermore Google has a mobile-first index for crawling websites on the web. The mobile-first index is a ranking system that looks at the mobile version of a page to evaluate its relevance to the user. Google also showcases websites on its SERP (Search Engine Results Page) that are AMP friendly. Obviously there are many ranking factors that come into play when Google determines how your site should be ranked on its SERP however the simple fact that most conversions happen on mobile (whether that be a successful transaction on a client's e-comers site or a sign up for a blogger's site) giving users the chance to optimize their site through Google's AMP framework gives us an even greater edge for Google rankings. Wordpress already has easy implementation of this but I would love to see this in Webflow. Webflow has already made it super simple to setup Google Analytics with a Webflow site. Let's keep going and help develop Webflow to be a platform that's not only great for amazing web design but also for Google Search Optimization which in turn would be great for more conversions and ultimately more profit.

WEBFLOW-I-6088,Improve webhooks,1,First: Currently I can only be notified about edits/updates/deletions on collection items. It would be nice to get updates for individual pages too. Second: Give full name of person/author in addition to id in the collection_item_update webhook. Similar to the site_publish webhook.Third: Give the full URL instead of just slug.

WEBFLOW-I-1496,Recurring billing (Subscriptions),1441,I know the ecommerce platform is in development but it would be nice to have recurring billing option for the users. If they select a product that has a recurring subscription they can go through the process and subscribe. They can login and manage their subscription options. I often have clients that need that and I also need it for myself. It would be even more unique feature to the platform.,11/10/2018,In progress,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1496
WEBFLOW-I-1555,Stripe iDeal payments with Ecommerce,1376,Stripe uses iDeal payments in Netherlands Belgium Luxemburg and some in Germany. Its like the creditcard for the US everybody uses this... and lots of companies don’t have a creditcard here.. I am sure this idea will not get loads of likes... but for me and lots of other designers Webflow ecommerce is useless without Stripe’s iDeal payments option here in the Netherlands!,06/11/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1555
WEBFLOW-I-2677,Disable/Remove Ecommerce Functionality,967,Have the ability to remove/disable the ecommerce functionality on a project.If you enable this to try it out or download a template which has it enabled there's currently no way to disable it.

WEBFLOW-I-6071,Clean Image URLs in Webflow CDN,10,Hey Webflow! Our agency is frustrated by Webflow's image naming practices and are hoping for some changes!  Problems SEO. The official Google reference on states that "Google uses the URL path as well as the filename to understand your images. Consider organizing your image content so that URLs are constructed logically." (Source) Unfortunately Webflow adds a bunch of junk characters to image names and does not store them in a logical file structure meaning Webflow sites lose this valuable SEO. Editing. Downloading images from Wordpress sites saves them with the same name that they were uploaded as making it easy to edit and reupload a file. On Webflow the file is renamed to the junk characters meaning you have to rename the file each time.  Suggested Solution In the Webflow CDN append the workspace and project name to the url so the url can still be unique and the image filename can be on its own. It would be great timing here to also add Replace Image functionality to the Asset Manager. Seems simple to just download edit and reupload but this would save tons of time.  Notes I've reviewed a few posts on this topic from Webflow including this one on this topic where the community manager cited limitations from Webflow's CDN or that Google doesn't actually use Image titles for SEO (citing a Stack Overflow post from 2012 back when keyword stuffing was prevalent). It would be helpful to hear an updated viewpoint from Webflow on this topic using up-to-date information.,13/06/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-6071

WEBFLOW-I-1528,Support an SVG-specific Element as an alternative to the Image element,1164,Currently SVGs can only be added through the Image element or the Embed element.

WEBFLOW-I-1422,Turn Webflow websites in Progressive Web Apps,960,Can you add the ability to upload two files a manifest.json file and a serviceworkers.js file to the location where the website is hosted. (these files are extremely small). Once we can upload these 2 files we can add a couple of javescript lines to the header of each page and we can start taking advantage of the Progressive Web Apps (PWA's). When a website is PWA compliant we can start using local cache so websites load even when there is no internet. In Africa everybody access the internet through a phone but a signal is not always available when we use local cache they can still see the website without internet connection (of course they need to visit the website before when there is internet) Also when the website is PWA compliant it can act like a native app on your cellphone.I exported a website from webflow added two files Manifest.json and serviceworker.js and added 10 lines of code in the header of each page and the website became WPS compliant. No other change are needed.,31/08/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1422
WEBFLOW-I-2038,Add modern File Types like JPEG 2000 JPEG XR and WebP,809,The Loading Time would be much faster. Google Page Speed say that it could be 7 seconds faster with this modern File types. Admin Note:Due to limited browser support it's unlikely that we'll build the ability to use JPEG 2000 JPEG XR or WebP until there's full browser support.,23/05/2019,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2038

WEBFLOW-I-6085,Enable commenting by Guest (content) Editors as well as the design team,1,As the  administrator/quality content controller of a site with Business Site Plan and free Workspace plan it would be very useful for me to be able to interact with my content creators who use the Editor and don't have access to the  Designer: both to make and to hear suggestions on improving site content and on better designing the site to meet content creator needs.,24/06/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-6085

WEBFLOW-I-39,Real time collaboration on a project,1146,We often have several design changes that need to be made and letting multiple designers access and make changes to the same project simultaneously would be incredibly valuable.,17/01/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-39
WEBFLOW-I-161,Custom order for Collection Items,1141,At the moment there is little possibility to easily achieve custom ordering of items of a collection. Outside in the CMS world—and I'm taking Drupal as an example—custom ordering is quite always achieved the same way: there is a custom "order" field that is updated anytime the order of items is manually changed in a backend section. Editors will manually reorder items by dragging them up and down the list and the value of the order field is updated after each drag. In the template the list is set to be sorted depending on this order field.A very popular module to do this on Drupal can be seen here: https://www.drupal.org/project/nodeorder A list and comparisons of the ordering modules can be seen here: https://www.drupal.org/node/398508,19/01/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-161

WEBFLOW-I-2357,Increase CMS item limit,628,10000 items may sound a lot but it’s extremely limiting even for small/medium blogs with many contributors especially if you want to implement custom tags. As it is now no blog/news site will be able to handle more than a few years of article creations before being forced off Webflow.,08/11/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2357

WEBFLOW-I-4962,Do NOT phase out the Client Billing feature!,186,Phasing out the "Client Billing" feature is a massive dissapointment for many agency and freelance users. Transitioning to Bonsai brings only pain points to the users related to i.e. costs management and client communication.,06/04/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4962
WEBFLOW-I-2335,Google reCAPTCHA v3 and v2 (invisible),545,At the moment webflow only supports Google reCAPTCHA v2 (checkbox) as mentioned on webflow university.  But it would even better to have reCAPTCHA v2 (invisible) as it does not require the 'I'm not a robot' checkbox. So we would be able to design forms seamlessly with the rest of the site design (see attached image for an example).  However if webflow could incorporate reCAPTCHA v3 then it would provide site owners with even more control and insight about their website visitors (both bots & humans). This would be a great selling point for us and webflow!  What do you guys think?,29/10/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2335
WEBFLOW-I-4265,Next Version of CMS API,283,Please continue development on the CMS API basic things like filtering and sorting Items by API is missing and it doesn't make any sense not continuing work on the CMS API because a lot of people are working with it through NodeJS or Zapier or Integromat or any other external service or backend code and more features would be gladly appreciated. Also being able to have the Item ID as a option to use in the Designer as a variable would be great to send CMS Item IDs through forms for example.,20/05/2021,In progress,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4265
WEBFLOW-I-1834,Offline Payment option for Ecommerce,554,Some clients especially with larger ticket items or items that are customized post purchase (where the cost could change) would be best served by allowing them to pay offline (by check or other method). This would allow orders to be accepted and dealt with and the payment to be mailed or whatever. the admin then could check a box to say it is paid for and fulfill it when they get the payment. Many clients do not want to pay processing fees on either side for multi-thousand dollar items but want to sell them online (many of these are older traditional businesses who typically process payments by mail or phone and don't want their cool new website to break their internal processes).,19/02/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1834
WEBFLOW-I-3855,Add Facebook Conversions API to Webflow servers,308,This is a crucial functionality for anyone who advertises using Facebook Pixel.

WEBFLOW-I-758,Webflow support on iPad Pro,753,guys why can we use webflow on iPad 12.9 pro? the screen is big enough the processing power is more than enough the resolution is higher than most laptops out there...if it is just because the UI is not designed for touch....well we don't need touch support apple pencil or any Bluetooth mouse will work on iPad just fine.

WEBFLOW-I-6084,Add transition delay to interactive elements,1,Currently the interactive elements (dropdown/slide menu slider tabs) don't have the option to add delay. Therefore it's difficult to make an outgoing transition because you're limited to the amount of time until the content slides or fades away. I attached an example I made fully custom the sliding animation across the image wouldn't be possible if this was made with the tabs element. Having no transition or a transition with no duration wouldn't work in this case because the content would be gone before the animation plays out. It's a useful function that is not difficult to understand but for more advanced users would have great benefit because you don't need to make the interactions yourself (as I had to with the example).

WEBFLOW-I-6083,Real device mockups in Preview mode,1,Previewing a mobile device in Webflow gives you a full browser height mockup not what your site will actually look like on an iPad/iPhone/Galaxy etc.,23/06/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-6083
WEBFLOW-I-6082,A native theming tool for Webflow,1,Why are we still building style guides in draft pages?

WEBFLOW-I-3881,Increase the items limit of Nested Collection Lists (currently max 5 only!!!),270,The Nested collection list function is super useful but it is currently limited to 5 items.  It is actually fine and reasonable to have a limit but not 5 only... Webflow team can you increase it to 20 or more?

WEBFLOW-I-236,Be able to style all forms elements (dropdown radio etc),717,Styling certain elements of forms have been difficult from the beginning of web design. Some modern frameworks offer either nicer default styles or the possibility to easily style any form component. Styling a form is important because it is still in 2017 the only component that is heavily handled visually by the browser defaults hence forms looking regularly different on Windows and Macs with also differences between browsers. Regularly forum users ask how to handle this: https://forum.webflow.com/t/best-way-to-design-this-complex-product-creation-form/38125 The image provided in the forum topic above (and attached here) is a good example of what we all would like to be able to produce. An incomplete list of what would be great to control: Additionally complicated forms need tables "zones" zones titles and labels...

WEBFLOW-I-105,Ability to create sites using a 'mobile-first' approach (mobile styles first in CSS cascade),666,In projects where mobile is the primary way an audience will view a site or app (and this number will probably only ever increase; one of my clients has 80% mobile views for example) – it often makes sense to start the cascade 'mobile-first' rather desktop first as webflow currently works – it helps designers developers and stakeholders keep focussed about their audience the content the effectiveness of the UI decisions and importantly generally just 'think' more from a mobile-orientated point of view (+ arguably some performance gains depending on how the cascade and code is setup). If a majority of your audience use mobiles – I can't think of any advantages of starting desktop-first. I find webflow's approach encourages mobile views to become basically stacked versions of the desktop view – and while agree that is essentially what most mobile sites are these days (and is often the best solution) I think the approach generally discourages more creative solutions to optimising the experience for small screens.

WEBFLOW-I-6008,SEO friendly pagination (correct canonical URL),13,Currently pagination in Webflow is not reflected in the canonical URL.

WEBFLOW-I-6068,Transfer a site to another workspace within the same account without unpublishing,4,My Webflow account has two workspaces.  I want to transfer a site from one to another.  In order to do this I must choose between two inconvenient and time consuming options that result in site downtime: Option 1 | Transfer a duplicate of the website  Duplicate the site you wish to transfer Transfer the duplicate website Cancel the Site Plan on the original website. [Downtime begins] Add a site plan to the duplicate website (Apply the coupon code) Add your custom domain to the website and publish [Downtime ends]  Option 2 | Transfer the original website Cancel the Site Plan on the original website.

WEBFLOW-I-214,Add / remove classes via Interactions,560,Webflow's interactions functionality is killer but it lacks the foundation of developing interactive content on the web: adding and removing classes. Normally when you build a site you associate certain behaviors / keyframes with particular classes. Then upon a trigger like hover or click you can add or remove a class which contains all the data about the beginning and end states together. It would be much easier to develop interactions with this ability! Right now all we can do is affect width / height opacity and "display". On the "interactions" page it appears to be "coming later" as an available action. Let's do it!,23/01/2017,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-214

WEBFLOW-I-1317,New "Smart" Editor,425,I think the current editor is very limited in how it works. It is missing a lot of critical features and actually isn't that helpful when adding new content. I think there is a difference between the CMS collection "data" and the "content" that can be created in a Rich Text Block. Ideally anything could be put into a Rich Text Block. Maybe it then becomes a Rich Content Block. The goal for a new editor could be to create a sort of Medium-style writing experience where the content block being written for could insert any type of content you've already defined. In this style of writing you could do things similarly to how Medium works.. Update text (h1 h2 h3 bold underline etc.) and add images videos but also add in components from Webflow that you've already created. Wouldn't it be ideal to just type the content and components based on labels that each component is given (h1 h2 h3 bold underline) and images videos or symbols? That way we don't need to place the content in the same order for all of the CMS items. This would allow for unique CMS item order where you are putting in content to one of these blocks and it gets designed based on the UI components that you have already created in your Webflow site's style guide. This would also make it more enjoyable to write in Webflow keeping designers and marketers on the site instead of using Google Docs or some other tool to do the writing first. This would also streamline the publishing process because people could make their edits and re-order content without needing to change the CMS template. The way you could add symbols or other CMS content would be to "reference" the other fields anywhere in your current CMS (this item or other items). For example if I'm using a Rich Content Block.. I might reference the "title" of my post using "@title" where I can actually get a "dynamic field insertion" into my Rich Content Block. This would allow me to easily update the "title" attribute at any time and my Rich Content Block would also update every instance of that reference. This could be tremendously scalable if you are referencing a global attribute many other blog posts. You could simply select that attribute by using the @ symbol. It would then allow you to look up content anywhere across your CMS. In that item or globally through a simple search. It then binds the reference after you select it.

The current temporary solutions for a Table of Content in the Webflow CMS are just too clunky especially for us non-developers. It’s time-consuming and frustrating to deal with. Most solutions are from third-parties and not from Webflow direct.Why do I request this? Table of Contents make articles look better and can lead to better SEO rankings. I’m not asking for anything fancy here. Just a basic Table of Content feature like what Google Docs or even MS Word has.It would be a game-changer for content-heavy websites like blogs and knowledge bases.

When that shipped I really thought you'd also be able to navigate from one post to the next (or previous). I know there are workarounds for this but the ones that can be done in Webflow (no additional code) aren't suitable for blogs with more than 10-20 posts. It seems like it would have gone hand in hand with the pagination of the lists. Can we pretty please with sugar on top get this?

WEBFLOW-I-100,Client Billing in Native Currency,418,At the moment I can't set up Client Billing as its in dollars and we bill in GBP Sterling.

WEBFLOW-I-74,The ability to have multiple page templates per collection.,402,I was thinking about this idea a lot the other day. Currently I conceptualize the CMS like this: The creation of a collection creates a template (collection page). The Template then has to be used with that URL string. Unless the collection is for internal use then the generated template will remain blank and in the template list. If we could create template pages independent of a collection then we could create designs that could fit multiple industries and flip the design on the fly for a new client. And it would allow us to create different sub-pages in the collection. This is very similar to the way Modx works and find it useful for larger sites. When creating a page in the collection I imagine the only option would be to choose a template. Once the template is chosen the form fields that were set up for that template would appear. Hope that's clear. It's clear in my head but hard to get out in writing.,18/01/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-74
WEBFLOW-I-2518,Clear all styles for an entire breakpoint with one click,213,Hi team! When a client comes back with changes in the design I usually start doing the changes in Desktop and then continue to do the changes on Tablet Mobile landscape and portrait. The problem I'm facing is that I probably have custom styles on Tablet Mobile landscape and portrait view and now I need to find those custom styles and delete or change them. My wish is to have a "Clear all styles of the children of this element" that have been added specifically for Tablet Mobile landscape or portrait breakpoints. So if I have a div block that is acting as a container of cards for instance I can select that div block and clear the styles in that div block.  Having this image as an example if I clicked “clear all styles” of this div block the blue styles would be reset. Just like holding down option and clicking on the blue style I want to reset but this would in one click clear all blue styles.,22/01/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2518

WEBFLOW-I-17,Firefox support for the Designer,390,When Webflow first launched we couldn't make the Designer work in Firefox due to a 16 year old bug in that browser that prevented us from styling scrollbars in a dark color: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77790 However we now have some JavaScript-based workarounds to avoid rendering native scrollbars and it should theoretically be possible to provide Firefox support (currently it you can open a project but it's forced into read-only mode) if there's enough demand for it. Note: Websites published in Webflow already work in Firefox - this idea refers only to making the main Designer application work inside of Firefox.,13/01/2017,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-17

WEBFLOW-I-6009,CMS Settings: Group fields Into sections and add custom headings,7,Would be great to have the ability to group CMS collection fields into sections with custom headings similar to how the current "Basic Info" and "Custom Fields" and are separated visually. Or even just the ability to insert a heading label between fields and we could rearrange accordingly under those labels.For example: We have a CMS collection for case studies that uses nearly all 60 fields with a lot of repeating similar fields for images. We do currently use prefixes but having the 60 fields but the ability to add a heading and groupings would create a faster and better UI/UX.,11/05/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-6009
WEBFLOW-I-6020,Add a 30 day period before a deleted website is fully deleted,6,Webflow absolutely needs to add a safeguard against accidentally deleting a website. A few suggestions could be a 30 day period before the website is deleted forever or a 2FA confirmation before a deletion executes. This will avoid situations such as: hacked account and malicious deletion disgruntle employees at the office accidental deletion accidentally leaving browser logged into WebFlow and someone deletes. Not only do I see this as a concern but I've had clients expressed to me that they are concerned that deleting a website is too easy.

WEBFLOW-I-1087,Show Collection items from multiple Collections in one Collection list,262,I think it should be possible to output within the collection list module two or more collections. Why? For example you have two collections A and B which displays work out of your portfolio. You need two collections because A and B have totally different layouts and fields but in your overview of your portfolio you want to display one list that should be sorted.

WEBFLOW-I-3437,Ability to sell and redeem Gift vouchers / cards in ecommerce,129,Gift vouchers and cards are a huge deal for clients now and even more relevant at the moment. They're simply expected by my clients as standard. This is something that is just not possible in Webflow at the moment (unless you are a developer of course in which case it might be but we're not all developers and that's the point in Webflow right?). Almost managed to integrate GiftUp via Zapier using Webflow's discounts but the discounts API is inaccessible at the moment anyway so you can't interact with it. As is using Giftup means managing two sets of discount codes and manually updating them in two places. This feature would mean I could for a lot of clients keep everything in webflow and use your eccommerce platform far more often (I've been able to use it once so far because of this as that client doesn't need gift vouchers or cards!) Yes there are workarounds and it can be sort of done with Foxy who will help you out everytime as they're excellent but you can't have remaining balances which my client's want.

WEBFLOW-I-6066,Remove default styling on all Native elements,2,Many elements come with pre-defined styling and 100% of the time I find this un-useful and a nuisance! E.g. the Navbar element has a grey background (how many people even want a grey background on their global navigation?) Hs come with predefined padding and so on. I would love a way to remove all default styling on elements.

WEBFLOW-I-1499,Allow Collection-Bound Pages Anywhere,198,Woot! Woot! Feature added 27-April-2023. Replace Collection Pages with Collection-Bound Pages VIDEO WALKTHROUGH-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTqGQZYvnhA Current collection pages have a number of design restrictions- Every CMS collection gets a collection page even if you don't want it Each CMS collection can only have one collection page even if you need more than that Collection pages cannot be within folders Collection pages cannot be password-protected The homepage cannot be a collection page Instead of treating collection pages as a separate thing and enforcing these rules it seems cleaner to be able to create a standard "static" page wherever you like and the "bind" it to a collection. That would be the definition of a collection-page. In this way you get to use all of the existing page-design mechanisms and solve all of the above problems- You don't need to create collection pages for CMS collections that don't need them e.g. "Publication Type"https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1212https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-982 You can Collection-bind the home page just like any other pagehttps://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-337 Freedom to organize your pages both visually in the designer UI and logically within Folders. Password-protection both on the page itself or on the parent folder. DESIGN NOTES From a design standpoint I think... The Collection-level Slug becomes meaningless as each page already has it's own Slug defined which makes more sense. Collection-bound pages follow the same rules as Folders for example I can have a static page named /mypageAND I can have EITHER a folder named /mypage OR a collection-bound page named /mypage I cannot have BOTH a folder named /mypage AND a collection-bound page named /mypage since the subpaths could conflict. I haven't tested this however I"m pretty cure it's already the case that you cannot create a folder under the path "/mypage" and a CMS collection with the slug "mypage" for the same reason.,15/10/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1499
WEBFLOW-I-139,Webflow interface in local languages (Editor Designer),267,I know that the vast majority of Webflow customers here are probably from English speaking countrieswith English speaking clients. However those working in countries with other native languages should add up to a good number too. I'd love to see the CMS interface translated into different languages. I certainly would be more comfortable to sell Webflow sites to clients whom I know are not that confident in English.

We are big fans of Webflow due to it's ease-of-use which allows our rotating volunteer staff to create and maintain websites with minimal web development knowledge. However the current pricing plans puts creating a full website out-of-reach for us (and I am sure for many others). It would be wonderful if a special discounted or free plan could be provided for eligible non-profits this could lead an increased audience of new organizations using Webflow (some eventually upgrading to larger plans). An even bigger benefit is following suit of many of the big internet services such as Godaddy Dreamhost & Slack who already offer free plans to non-profits. These free plans can be considered charitable donations for IRS tax-reporting purposes offering Webflow the opportunity to receive a considerable charitable tax deduction every year so the scenario is win-win!

WEBFLOW-I-695,Automatic Sitemap Improvements,241,Before I start I know you can manually create the sitemap hence the request to improve automatic sitemaps :) The problem: We have a lot of pages "in progress" and a lot of designers working on our project so at any given time there are many pages not fit for public consumption. There are also certain types of pages you don't want to be indexed. e.g. paid media pages and conversion pages where it's necessary to exclude from the public domain and indexing. Current workflow: The current solution is to password protect the draft pages but they are still included in our site map which presents a couple of problems. Current solution: The current solution it to manually create the sitemap but who really wants to do that. Meh. Dream solution - automagic sitemap: The request here is to make the automatic sitemap smarter. Options: There are possibly some further improvements what come to mind are auto generating the robots.txt file from the resulting options but I'll leave that to your genius team.,17/05/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-695

WEBFLOW-I-1438,Allow custom CSS/LESS visible in Designer,186,I really like the Webflow Designer for composing pages and setting some basic properties like fonts padding etc in combination with break points. However as a coder I sometimes really miss the refined control full CSS gives. A few examples: Of course you can add your styles in the 'custom code' editor. The downside of this is that it is not executed when viewing your site in the Designer or even previewing the site. So when you start using this the process of building a site suddenly becomes a lot more clunky with you having to publish switch refresh and then switch back to the designer again all the time. A feature that I really liked in Squarespace was the custom CSS/LESS box. You can use all the power of LESS (variables nesting etc) — or just plain CSS and the changes to the style are immediately visible in the editor. Like Webflow they don't execute custom code in the editor (for obvious reasons) but they do apply your custom styles. I think this is a relatively simple to add backwards compatible feature (<style> blocks in the custom code will of course still work) that will make the Webflow platform so much more powerful. As a first implementation it can simply be put next to the Custom Code box. But even better would be integrating it in the Designer: this way you don't have to switch back and forth all the time and can see the effect of your changes without having to publish. You retain the ease of use of the Designer while not putting coders at a disadvantage. This will also help with a number of items on the wishlist like these: 1. https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-8932. https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/DESIGNER-I-53. https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1334. https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-65. https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1433 I hope you will consider it and let me know what you think.

WEBFLOW-I-20,Increase the number of CMS references allowed,250,I've had situations where I have a page designs that need lots of fields to accommodate the different types of content on the page.

WEBFLOW-I-1584,Quote Request Checkout Option,179,Most businesses that manufacture or distribute customized or highly engineered products initiate their sales process by using a quote request process. The idea is simply that a customer or prospect can view the various catalogs and products on the website (generally without prices showing) and then place specific items of interest into a shopping cart in order to request a price quote. In this scenario the subsequent checkout process is identical to an eCommerce transaction EXCEPT that there is no payment information requested or processed. Instead a "zero dollar" or "free" order is processed and logged by the system with order acknowledgements being sent to the inquiring customer and quote order notifications being sent to the site owner. Another key requirement in this "quote request" scenario (that has already been promised for the initial rollout) are product options and variants. I currently have a number of large manufacturing and distribution clients that have just such a "quote management" system but they are built on Adobe's Business Catalyst and will need to be migrated (to Webflow??) prior to the announced end of life for that platform. The Webflow eCommerce offering is shaping up to be exactly what is needed. The only missing pieces seem to be the "skipping over" of the payment process and (in an ideal world) the addition of more flexible form submission notification options to route different types of order requests to the most appropriate individuals within the business. Because this is more like an option "skip a step" than it is a request for new functionality I am keeping my fingers crossed that a "quote request" option might still be feasible within the framework of the initial rollout...

WEBFLOW-I-354,Site staging or selective editor publishing,244,I've noticed while working on site updates for a client's live site: I can make edits to pages within Designer and not publish. Then if my client were to go into Editor and create a post (or any other changes) and they publish their edits my edits get pushed to the live site as well. It would be nice to have a way to control what gets published between Designer and Editor. I imagine it might be simpler to have an entirely separate "staging site" as opposed to selecting individual pieces or elements to publish. You guys are the experts though. ; ] Nicky P,06/02/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-354
WEBFLOW-I-1023,Scheduling / Appointment Booking,212,I recognize that this wish list idea is more of a marketing tool than just a design / content idea but it's warranted. One thing just about every website builder lacks is a native integrated scheduling platform. (Hair salons groomers consultants mechanics etc) There is one website company that offers both an integrated scheduler/appointment tool AND also has a built-in CRM to their dashboard but the design editor is no way as advanced as Webflows'. Would be nice though to have a scheduling / appointment tool native to Webflow - OR if not a native integration to one without using Zapier or something like that or one of the embed codes.  One of the upside's for Webflow is you could charge an added fee. The top scheduling tools all carry a $50/mo+ service fee. I don't think clients would at all be opposed to paying $20-30/mo additional if there was a nice easy NATIVE scheduling tool built into the same dashboard of their website...,01/12/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1023
WEBFLOW-I-784,HTTP response headers security,226,I am working with a client that is asking of we can set various security-related headers from our webflow hosted site: content-security-policy x-content-type-options x-frame-options x-xss-protection strict-transport-security. I can really see the value in being able to set some of these via an advanced options section in site settings to really help secure your site. For example as a simple one if I don't want someone embedding my site in an iframe setting x-frame-options would be pretty nice. I can see that some of the others could get you into trouble but having a set of options for each that won't completely break my site would be nice Just to confirm there is no way to set an option to control any of these correct? I couldn't find anything. In that case it sounds like a feature request but I wanted to toss this out there to get some general thoughts and comments I'm no expert on website security. written by: esassaman https://forum.webflow.com/t/setting-various-webflow-host-http-headers-for-security/44925 Thanks Dominik,08/07/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-784

WEBFLOW-I-1389,Form file uploads within a limit on CMS Hosting,183,When a file upload is needed on a website it is generally for a very niche use case (ie. job application) which won't need much storage or bandwidth. It's hard to justify an extra $240 a year for this so people will likely go to third-party services such as uploadcare.com who offer 500 files/500mb for free with 5gb bandwidth. This is something I'd ideally like to avoid as I don't want my user's data/content spread all over the place. Please consider allowing file uploads within a limit similar to that of uploadcare. Surely this will lead to more upgrades to Business Hosting in the future when people hit those limits – rather than paying the third party.,10/08/2018,In progress,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1389
WEBFLOW-I-1654,Adjustable Screen Height in Mobile Designer View,170,Despite needing an update to reflect the latest mobile devices the ability to adjust viewport width in the designer is invaluable when using webflow's mobile design preview for creating mobile-specific CSS classes. However when trying to perfect a site design for mobile clients it is a big limitation that the viewport height cannot also be infinitely adjusted to screen heights of popular mobile devices in the same manner. In almost all of our site designs I rely heavily on specifying div block and section heights as percentages of viewport height (100VH) for visual appeal but this is obviously dramatically different to real device testing when relying on a desktop window height for designing. While it is obviously possible to resize and drag a desktop chrome window to different sizes this then makes the designer unusable for specifying new styles as all the designer buttons are lost in the tiny height. Please can a new vertical sizing bar be implemented for the mobile preview with popular mobile devices marked along the pixel measurement axis in the webflow designer?  See also https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1655 for adjustment of the desktop preview for ultra-large and high resolution displaysAdmin Note:It's currently possible to resize the height of the browser window to mimic the height of a phone screen and still access styling controls.

WEBFLOW-I-5985,Add custom access group fields + access group collection list in account page,6,Currently it's impossible to create a list of access groups that a user belongs to in their account page. This is obvious functionality. If I have 1000 courses on my site and the user has access to 3 of them there should be a way for me to easily display the 3 that they have access to and link them to the content. Instead the only way is to force them to search through all available courses and remember which ones they already bought.  One solution (although not the only one) is to have an access groups collection list that can be added to the account page in the same way as the current subscriptions element. This new element would display to the user each access group that they're a part of.  In combination with that there would also need to be the ability to create custom fields in the access group collection.  This would allow me to create a custom link field which would link to a dashboard that has further links to all gated content for each access group. This way the user only has to go Account -> {Access Group} -> {Content},27/04/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5985

WEBFLOW-I-5854,Limit CMS items count differently per breakpoint,14,Limit items are currently not possible to adjust per breakpoint. That means that we currently have to display the same amount of items even though the screen is significantly smaller.  There is also another scenario which makes me miss the ability to set item limit per breakpoint: Using a grid to display a collection. Want to display 1 row of 3 items on the laptop/desktop. On mobile I stack these three underneath each other. On tablet there is enough space for 2 items per row but this will cause it to become only 1 item on the next row... In this case it would be more ideal to change the limit to 4 on this breakpoint.  Currently the only workaround I know is to add multiple collection lists and set visibility and limits individually. Not ideal but it works. Hope you can make limitations more dynamically. ,05/02/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5854

WEBFLOW-I-2600,Client billing for South Africa,106,Hi Webflow team and community! Currently there is no option to setup billing for South African businesses and there is no option to setup client billing for South African clients. The only alternatives we have is the following: If I go the USA route my first problem is that Stripe does not support South Africa yet. That means I will need to go through Stripe Atlas which will help me to form a business and create a bank account in the USA. Second problem the setup fee to do this costs $500 and there additional costs. The third problem if I go this route then I will have to charge my clients in dollars instead of rands which is a big no-no for most clients. My second option is to create the website in webflow and convert it to wordpress. I think this might be the best option however there are additional costs and parties involved. I would prefer to do everything under one roof. The third option is to pay out of pocket and send the client an invoice each month but this process is not ideal and leaves a lot of room for risk on my side. I understand that you cannot add South Africa to billing until Stripe supports South Africa but is there no alternative? Paypal supports South Africa. Is there any possibility that webflow can integrate with Paypal or one of the South African payment gateways below? It would be great if you could integrate with a payment gateway that would allow South African businesses to charge clients in Rands.,24/02/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2600

WEBFLOW-I-6074,Allow editing of text in designer.,1,Should be in there by default imho.  Seems like so many people have to search how to edit text.  Look at the forum.  It's a sign of failure that anyone at all has to ask how to edit text.  I finally figured out that I had to keep clicking it forever to get it to show a curser because another element was on top of it even though  the designer said I was on the text and showed me every style option for that text.  Again the fact that I'm even writing this after seeing so many similar post in the forum is a bad sign guys. How to edit text?  Think about that.  People have to ask that for webflow.

WEBFLOW-I-1257,Ability for Zapier to work with reference fields.,144,When calling for a reference field I would expect the following behaviours. If an item doesn't exist the CMS should create a new item in the referenced collection from the zap. If an item does exist the CMS should reference that item.

However it would be very nice for this to exist within Webflow natively. I'd like the creation of collection items to be a customizable experience. It would be great for fields to have default values and even dynamic defaults (for example I could have a Date field always default to the next Sunday). It would be great to be able to arrange fields in groups that can be shown or hidden (example I have an "Announcements" collection and each item can include up to two links and two files. In my customized form I have "Add Link?" and "Add File?" as checkboxes linked to sections that are hidden until the user checks the box. This could work in a hundred different ways but it would be great to be able to customize that experience to make it as user-friendly as possible to the editors.,18/05/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-6025

Similar to Squarespace WordPress (Elementor) and nearly every other CMS/platform out there. For some reason Webflow restricts editors to adding CMS items and using rich text blocks only. Unbelievable this has still not been added to WebFlow after all these years.We would have adopted WebFlow as our CMS of choice for clients years ago if this basic (compared to other CMS') functionality was available for our clients.

WEBFLOW-I-2722,Webflow University Certification,88,"Degree or skills?" we all know the drill. Nowadays many companies are beginning to prioritize the latter over a fancy piece of paper. Unfortunately this is not true everywhere. There are still several countries and companies that rely heavily on certification. So you might be amazing at what you do but without a paper to support your skills you won't even be considered as an applicant. For this reason I think it would be great if webflow University implemented some kind of certification like Google Skillshop. For those who don't know Google Skillshop it is an education platform where you can take different courses and when you finish you can pay a small amount of money to take a test and get "Google certified".,06/04/2020,In progress,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2722

Silly.I don't want to have multiple content pages under one Access group because then a customer can buy one report and then access them all...So please....there would be three solutions. 1.

WEBFLOW-I-2847,Make "Conditional Visibility" Server-side,83,Currently conditional visibility is a simple class assignment with Display:None. This makes it so that when you have a lot of content-rich sections hidden conditionally the page will still load them into the DOM and consumes data for the user. This is not ideal for CMS pages that have unique sections and headers based on categories.  For example if I want to have a unique hero header with a background video for each CMS item I'd need to create all of them on the template page and hide them conditionally. Under current circumstances the user will have to load all of these to load the page.  Server-side management of conditional visibility would make sure that the hidden sections never reach the DOM and are hence never loaded.,14/05/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2847
WEBFLOW-I-469,Conditional Form Fields,169,It would be great if Webflow Forms could have conditional form fields (without any need to use jquery or an external form builder) so the next field shows depending on the answer to the previous question.

WEBFLOW-I-2746,Apply global classes to  elements independently from its current CSS selector,81,This will help to easier apply and update global and combo-classes throughout all break-points. Currently If I want to update the style of an element with its own class plus 3 global classes in a breakpoint different from the base one I need to do one of the following: Delete all 3 global classes for the element in that specific breakpoint apply new styles and reapply the 3 global classes. (Most of the time I don't do this approach as I always forget the global classes that were applied in the beginning). Duplicate that element remove the 3 global classes from the duplicated element give styles to my class in that breakpoint and finally remove the duplicated element. There are a lot of Webflow users that rely on global classes for every project specially those trying a utility-first approach. This feature will benefit on three ways: A more maintainable less-confusing class structure. Smoother workflow when making our designs responsive. First-time and beginners users will understand the concept behind global and combo-classes earlier. There should be two CSS-selector boxes in the Designer UI one for "normal" and combo-clasess and one for global classes. "Normal" and combo classes can't go in the global class box and viceversa.A global class need to be created first as a normal class and there should be an option to make it global. Once a "normal" class turns global it will change from the normal-css-selector box to the global-selector box.There should be a background color change (or any other visual clue) in the styles panel when switching from styling "normal" and combo classes to styling global classes so it makes more clear what type of classes is the user updating.Attached is a simple example of the selector boxes UI.,13/04/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2746

WEBFLOW-I-193,Ability to create new static pages through the Editor,152,Clients have been frustrated with the inability to add their own pages. I know a new collection item creates a new page but that doesn't meet their needs. I reviewed an older post where someone had requested this and someone's response was that we designers support our clients but some of my clients simply are unwilling to pay for me to go create pages for them when they know that they can easily do that on Wordpress (and yes I explain the benefits of Webflow over Wordpress but that doesn't change their opinion).,21/01/2017,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-193

WEBFLOW-I-1678,Klaviyo Ecommerce CRM Integration,106,Yes many SMBs use Mailchimp so that integration should already be on wishlist but professional Shopify sellers use Klaviyo for email marketing. A deep data integration would put Webflow truly out in front. Webflow+Klaviyo zapier already exisits but direct deep data integration would be much better & truly help stores sell more through advanced segmentations & dynamically generated email content. I think saw somewhere Webflow is building your own email features but might as well integrate with big dog to get more users to switch & get feedback from for your own CRM. (need more than just notification/ transactional emails). Money comes from automations & win back campaigns. If you can't tell I like Klaviyo. Check out their Mailchimp comparison charts to see why.

WEBFLOW-I-1988,Add Filters & Sort to Reference Collection List,97,Hi The filters on a standard Collection provide ‘Sort Order’ and ‘Filters’ but these do not appear to be available when you use a reference field (multi-reference etc) on a Collection List. However as with the main collection you would most likely require the same filters on the Reference Collection list. I understand that you can manually order the reference items within the CMS with a rudimentary ordering of selecting first second third reference item but this is not a workable way to manage collections especially if you are regularly adding to them nor does it provide hiding elements with toggle etc. Please look into adding this functionality to improve filtering in CMS.

WEBFLOW-I-5092,Overhaul the "Collaborators can edit this element" system,25,The ability to control what a client can edit and what they cannot is a crucial part of any site design- but in Webflow it needs an overhaul. Key things it needs; The ability to allow/deny editing of elements hierarchically so that the setting cascades (see notes for approach) Make it easier for designers to see what is editable by collaborators and what is not. Allow the ability to prevent editing of CMS-bound items. Currently the "Collaborators can Edit" option is gone on CMS-bound items which leads to editing catastrophes as in... Never allow editing of elements which are bound through a CMS Reference Field. Users don't cannot tell they are e.g. renaming ALL blue shoes to red rather than changing THIS pair to red. Make them do it in the Collection page instead where they can change the item Referenced. Details and some ideas on approach; Make the control of elements that are editable-by-collaborators hierarchical & cascading There are a lot of ways to do this but I think the best and easiest way to implement this is to add a new "grouping" virtual element to the element hierarchy. The Page would default to everything non-editable but the designer can add new "editable area" nodes to the hierarchy and drag in whatever contents they want. Likewise if you add a right-click menu to the element hierarchy pane you could right click on any element and "make this area editable by collaborators" which would wrap it in one of the groups. You could have as many groups as you want so designers can choose exactly which regions are editable including everything inside BODY if they want to. That grouping element would not actually render as any kind of HTML element it's just a grouping indicator to govern editor behavior. This simplifies things tremendously both on the cascading/resetting problem and on designers being able to see and control what's editable. That kind of virtual grouping element would be very helpful too for things like secured page parts that should only display when you are logged in ( with the upcoming membership & auth feature ). Also described here;https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4550 And discussed here;https://discourse.webflow.com/t/limiting-collaborator-editing/68348 Add a visual indication of editable/non-editable Easiest way here is also in the Element Hierarchy- color code items to indicate that they are editable by collaborators. That visualization can be switched on/off by a button at the top of the element hierarchy pane. The grouping indicator helps with this but highlighting editable elements directly in the tree is much more helpful so the designer can spot them. Note that only editable elements matter e.g. images text and rich text elements. Elements like DIVs don't need indication. Ideally if "view editable items by collaborator" is switched on that indication would also appear in the main WYSIWYG editor window as well so you can see visually which parts of the page are editable. Allow the ability to prevent editing of CMS-bound items Currently the "Collaborators can Edit" option disappears for CMS-bound items which leads to editing catastrophes as in... Never allow editing of elements which are bound through a CMS Reference Field Catastrophic when users make a text edit here and don't know the impacts. https://discourse.webflow.com/t/limiting-collaborator-editing/68348/16?u=memetican ,26/05/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5092
WEBFLOW-I-1757,Allow permanent deletion of PDFs and Images so they cannot still be accessed at their original URL after deletion,102,Currently when deleting a file from the asset manager it isn't actually deleted and remains accessible at the old URL to allow webflow to include it in site backups. There are multiple reasons this is concerning from a security perspective: I propose a number of potential solutions that could close this security concern: 1) In the asset manager have a tickbox to show all "archived" files so they can be deleted fully 2) When deleting a file assume it is to be deleted permanently but ask if the user would like to maintain a copy for backup purposes 3) Store all backup-only assets in a secure bucket within Webflow's AWS environment rather than have them remain on a publicly accessible server. https://forum.webflow.com/t/final-deletion-of-a-file-in-the-asset-manager/76133/7 for more info.,21/01/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1757

For example I would want to rename the following classes if I was actually able to see them one above the next in the Style Manager: navlink-Anavlink_bnavlink_Cnav-linkD. or modal header 1Modalheader2modal header_3 Additionally... if we could see how many times a class had been used in the current project that would be great.

WEBFLOW-I-6065,Better Error Handling & Recovery,1,Context: A site of mine was recently corrupted during a 'restore backup' making it impossible to publish unpublish load the designer or do just about anything with the site. Now it goes without saying I cannot thank the Webflow Support Team enough for their resolving the issue promptly especially as this issue was rare. However what would be even better is if the issue was preempted in the first place. As such I would like to make the following recommendations in light of my experience: Show Error Tracebacks from Browser Console Downloadable Bug Reports Communicate Failed Restores Validate Before Publishing More In Depth Error Explanations Ensure Webflow Support Is Reachable Recommendation 1: Show Error Tracebacks from Browser Console When the site crashed I was met with a prompt of "Something went wrong while trying to open your site. If you are unable to access your project after clearing your browser cache please visit https://support.webflow.com for assistance." which in itself is a good start. Recommendation: The prompt should display what code triggered the error from the browser console and provide a layman's explanation of what it means. For example:Something went wrong while trying to open your site. The issue that arose was 'TypeError: r is null'. This likely means '<insert lay explanation of why this kind of error might occur>'. If you are unable to access your project... Recommendation 2: Downloadable Bug Reports The prompt showed attachments for the bug report but didn't allow for the bug report to be downloaded. Recommendation: Let users download the bug report so users can forward it to the support team when they contact them. Recommendation 3: Communicate Failed Restorations When I went to restore an earlier backup nothing indicated that the restoration had failed. It was only through going to the browser console that I was notified that the process had failed due to a Syntax Error. Recommendation: Communicate through either a prompt or a change in the button style that a site backup has failed. Recommendation 4: Validate Before Publishing Similarly when going to publish the site feedback was “Publish could not be completed please try again.” However the publishing of the site was successful it just resulted in a blank page. Recommendation: Validate that sites don't raise errors before publishing. If the site is somehow invalid do not push the new site out. Instead show that the publish has failed and raise the error then. Recommendation 5: More In Depth Error Explanations To that previous point “Publish could not be completed please try again.” did not communicate why it had failed. And when I went to unpublish the site communicated “Failed to unpublish. Please try again!” which was unhelpful. Recommendation: Offer more in depth error explanations when critical activities like publishing and unpublishing fail. The errors should include: A traceback to the code causing the error A layman's explanation of the error A downloadable bug report A direct mailto link to Webflow's Support Zendesk. Ideally it should prepopulate some of the email with the desired template/form of the email. Recommendation 6: Ensure Webflow Support Is Reachable The biggest painpoint was determining how to contact Webflow support directly. The webflow support page does not contain a valid link to contact support. I had to look up a prior email I had sent months before to recollect the proper link. Recommendation: Fix the link at support.webflow.com. Leaving it as a blank link is dare I say crueler than having no link at all.,08/06/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-6065

WEBFLOW-I-726,MLS listing integration,119,One of the issues I've been running into with some online apps such as the ones for the MLS property listings is the difficulty of connecting data. I've been trying to feed SimplyRets into our Webflow sites but after extensive discussions with numerous developers the cost was prohibitive so I finally decided to use WordPress and install their plugin they provide to make the integration. I then mapped the menus back to Webflow site so it looks like the same site. It would be nice if you could do something about integrating MLS listing integrations since Real Estate is a major industry. I essentially am using Wordpress to host the MLS via the plugin.

It doesn't need any logic/functionality built into it beyond being a replica of what we see as designers in the CMS Collections. (Example image below)I could picture it as a category of "element" that you can drag and drop into your webpage organised by CMS Collection name.

WEBFLOW-I-6054,Allow devlink to sync code components back into Webflow,1,Right now devlink can only "sync" components from Webflow into a react project. This is really just component-scoped code export.  For use-cases where the website is hosted on Webflow and the designer + client want to continue to modify the components it would be incredibly useful to add the capability for devlink to sync in the opposite direction.  Naturally this is a difficult thing for Webflow to build when most developers will want to refactor the code components devlink produces. However even if devlink required developers to keep the file organization and toolset devlink produces it would still be extremely useful for teams that want extensible components and the full Webflow experience.The driving force behind this request is that the Webflow designer and CMS editor are powerful time-saving advantages to Webflow's platform. Right now the experience of modifying designer-built components with custom code is poor and time-consuming. DevLink offers a more streamlined alternative by exporting into a Next.JS project but loses those powerful features that made staying in Webflow advantageous.,06/06/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-6054
WEBFLOW-I-6022,Add and edit Components as Content Editor,2,Being able to add/edit/remove Components as a Content Editor and not only as a Designer.This feature would have to come together with the feature to add/remove pages as an editor (which is not possible at the moment). A possible User Journey with the new Editor-feature A client has an anniversary and wants to create a new Anniversary-page and a new teaser-section on the home page. He creates a new sub-page adds different pre-designed components and rearranges them (changing the order of the components). Then he enters the content into the components (text images etc.). After that he adds a teaser-component to the home page and links the Call to Action to the newly created page.  – by now all of this would have to be done by the programmer of the website.  I know that a feature like this would automatically create the need for other features.

None of the services available (such as OneSignal) can be used because they necessitate uploading files to the root directory or some intertwining with Zapier.

In the worst cases a client ends up trying to replace a background image or increase a headline by 10x the character count or some just gets confused in the editor who the edit options highlight.

WEBFLOW-I-5981,Ability to detach custom code section from site settings,3,Hi everyone I've been using Webflow for a while and while I love the platform I've noticed that the custom code section within the site settings can sometimes be a bit cumbersome to work with. I'm writing today to suggest a feature that I believe would greatly enhance the user experience for those of us who frequently use custom code in our Webflow projects. Specifically I would love to see the ability to detach the custom code section from the site settings and pop it out into a separate window or tab. This would make it much easier to view and edit custom code without having to constantly switch back and forth between the site settings and the code itself. I think this feature would be especially helpful for developers who are working on more complex projects as well as for non-developers who are still learning the ropes of custom code. It would also make it easier to collaborate with other team members as you could have the custom code window open in one tab while working on other aspects of the project in another. Overall I believe that this feature would be a valuable addition to Webflow and I hope that the team will consider implementing it in a future update. Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have any questions or feedback on this idea.

WEBFLOW-I-1616,Billing in Native currency/ Annual Billing,81,Dear wonderful Webflow team I really love your product and your design innovation - and have used Webflow for my own website and a few clients BUT unfortunately your huge downfall in the Billing/ Client Billing/ Invoicing area is REALLY letting your product down.The fact that you promote yourself as an ideal platform worldwide and as a trustworthy competitor to Wordpress - Billing clients in their native currency should really be a fundamental must for a platform of your size and reputation. My clients are getting increasingly frustrated because of multiple issues such as:1.) They are getting charged a conversion fee because it's not charged in their native currency2.) They are getting charged this conversion fee monthly because you haven't made annually billing available (which is deceptive because you advertise like you do).3.) I can't even rectify this issue by hosting them with someone else because you haven't created a function for people to choose to host their Webflow CMS with someone else.These are fundamental functions that shouldn't be an issue with a company like Webflow - and not only does it make your product look unreliable and unprofessional - it reflects badly on me to all my clients also. These issues can be big deal breakers for clients.I'm a designer and not really a developer and Webflow has given me the power to be both (WHICH IS WHY I LOVE WEBFLOW) - AND I really don't want to have to consider other options/ alternatives to Webflow. But these issues are negatively impacting my client relationships and putting pressure on me to have solve problems that shouldn't even be there in the first place.I have found many many requests from devoted Webflow users for these issues to be fixed over the past few years and no where have I seen a response from Webflow to action fixing these issues!

WEBFLOW-I-5537,Improve the onboarding experience for clients,12,Webflow is a platform with 2 main users:Clients and designers.Setting it apart from services like Wix and Squarespace - Webflow is too complex for most of the end-users that will pay for the hosting and usage of the site.Meaning the clients.However: Most of webflows interfaces totally ignores this fact and exists only for designers even though 99% of the designers in webflow will just forward the bill to the client if they are not hired in the company using the site.In the days of client billing the clients only needed to see two interfaces:- The link to fill in payment-details for client-billing- The editorBoth were simple and designed with clients in mind. After client-billing are phasing out and workspaces are phasing in - the client-experience is now not nearly as simple - and to me it seems they are forgotten in terms of design and user-experience. This is very dangerous - because it might negatively impact the end-clients experience of the platform. This might lead them away from webflow and onto other alternatives. Let me explain how:In the new workspace-era; the ideal flow for clients are like this:Step 1 - Freelancer/agency designs site in own workspaceStep 2 - Client creates a workspace and adds billing detailsStep 3 - Site is transferred to clients and freelancer/Agency gets access (for free once the feature is ready)This is ideal because most customers demand ownership of their site and account but from the point of creating it - they will not use it other than as editors.The problem here arises in step 2:Please try to log out of your acccount and follow the process as "new user" in webflow. This process will end in the creation of a new workspace but is entirely designed for advanced users without non-techy clients in mind.The questions in the onboarding-guide are implying that the user are going to build a site on their own and the onboarding ends directly in the designer - which I know for sure will confuse my clients.My wish is for webflow to improve the on-boarding-experience for clients. You have the bright minds to do so but here are some suggestions:Give me as designer a url I can send the client while telling them to create a workspace. The user-experience from this link is entirely designed and thought out for non-techy-users who does not care about the designer and only needs to do the following:Add informationAdd payment detailsGive freelancer/Agency accessIn addition: the list of sites in the dashboard will always take you to the designer if you don't click the small dots in the corner and go directly to site settings. This is a behaviour that is ok for designers but not ok for clients as they will get lost in the designer when what they want is to get an overview over their site. I suggest to change the default-action when clicking a site to open settings and add the "designer"-option in the 3-dot-button instead.I hope this will be something that can be prioritized and carried out in a fast and simple manner.Thank you!,14/10/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5537

How do I get them all access to that account/site without making each and every client add each of my staff individually? To me the idea of an agency account is... “hey I want you (agency) to have access to my account so your team can continue to work on the site for me (client). Let me add you as a guest agency.”  What should happen then is that everyone that I have in my agency has access to those accounts under my agency account so they can work on those sites.

This is all well and good if the client has budget to pay you to change it every time however if you're looking to create a solution for your client that makes it easy to update and rearrange their projects its really not that achievable with Webflow.  I feel a repeater type field or even reordering of CMS fields would instantly make a huge difference to the quality of product you can create for clients.

To further clarify I'm referring to the actual date selector input field within the collection screens: see screenshot Commonly users will bypass using the dropdown calendar and enter the date values manually for speed which they'll naturally do in their native date format.

WEBFLOW-I-6049,Request for Improved .WebM Transparency Support...,1,Dear Webflow Community I am writing to request an enhancement in the support for the .WebM video format. I have noticed that when a .WebM video containing transparency is uploaded on your platform the transparency is not maintained and instead a black background is displayed. This issue significantly affects the utility of .WebM files as it limits creative freedom and the possibilities for producing high-quality content. The .WebM format holds great potential especially because of its support for transparency and it would be highly beneficial if your platform could fully support this feature. I've noticed that you're already working on integrating Spline which is quite exciting. While you're working on that it would be fantastic if you could also consider enhancing .WebM (trancparency) support.   A transtransparent video with alpha channel encodings using VP8/9. The result was flawless. After uploading it to Webflow it will probably become a codec. .WebM is then no longer transparent and therefore unusable for the project and for future plans.  Yes Webflow already has a lot of possibilities for animations but sometimes customers also have pre-made and this type has long been missing in the designer. That's why I'd like to write it again. Please work to ensure that transparency remains. Not everyone always wants to watch in a new way like Spline even though I've watched Spline before I would just have that powerful little feature that the transparency stays with the videos.  I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter and hope that improving .WebM support will be considered in your future plans.

I'm having to duplicate certain elements for different breakpoints and apply unique animations to each. This becomes a mess when your animations are based on class because the classes of the duplicated elements are identical to the classes of the original elements. I've found that multiple animations controlling a single element will break each of the corresponding animations.

WEBFLOW-I-4272,Higher priority for fixing bugs,29,I would rather have a product that does 10 things well and without frustration than one that does 15 things but only if you fight and hack your way through it. I'm not alone in this. I run into bugs very often in Webflow--to the point where I would say it's perhaps the buggiest major piece of software I've ever used. Commonly I look a bug up in the forum and find reports of it by other users dating years back--and often with Webflow staff chiming in saying "we're about to fix it" which clearly never happened. I used to report bugs often myself--none are fixed up to two years later and counting. Too often I even get the run-around from the staff member answering the message claiming that a problem that is clearly a bug is actually intended. I've long ago given up reporting bugs. I understand a young and cash-strapped company prioritizing development of new features. However you're no longer young or cash-strapped. Continuing with this general philosophy might work in the short term but will fail you and your users in the long term. Just look at the number of users who gave up on Windows and moved to Apple in the 00s. Or the number of people who ditched GM cars in favour of Japanese in the 90s. Time and again across markets consumers show that they will flock to the most solidly built product often making sacrifices to do so.

WEBFLOW-I-1485,GREEN GEEKS HOSTING,65,I used to use green geeks for my web hosting but have since stopped due to my need for CMS and the fact that webflow is such a darn good web design development and CMS platform. However I am sorely missing my hosting with green geeks knowing that my hosting choice was having a positive impact within the industry of web hosting which is one of the largest users of energy. Eventually I will devise a way to move away from hosting with webflow and using a green hosting company. I would love if webflow offered a green hosting plan (check out green geeks model its really awesome) or offered someway to integrate third party hosting from a green company without exporting my sites out of webflow.

WEBFLOW-I-5762,The ability to publish individual pages,7,When working on a project clients often ask us for future amends to a page they do not wish to go live until a certain date. But then subsequently want other amends to be made live. We then can't push these amends live as we have already done the time sensitive ones. And have to wait till that date before we can publish the whole lot. The ability to have a checkbox in each individual static page where you can tick or untick update content on publish  would be very handy. This way you could go through the project and uncheck any pages you wish to remain the same as the current live site and only publish or "update' the ones they want to see changes on.

WEBFLOW-I-4965,Add a Site Administrator user (now that you're killing Client Billing),16,Webflow needs to add an optional Site Administrator user to all paid site plans. (Now that it's killing Client Billing) Webflow has shot itself in the foot. It's eliminated client billing and Client Billing was one of the primary reasons many designers both freelancers and agencies have made Webflow their platform of choice. Sure Webflow is at the forefront of the no-code movement right now but the laws of commerce won't let it hold that position forever. So Webflow what makes it easy to adopt you as our platform of choice is not only the great web builder you've created but the client billing service that makes it easy to take care of our customers. And for us freelancers our customers are the most important thing in the universe. The ability for customers to pay directly for their service is a key component in customer care. What we learned a few years after the web design boom in the early 2000s is that running a web management company is difficult and full of pitfalls. Of course at first we saw huge potential as "web designers" because we could make a decent living designing beautiful websites for our clients but we could easily sustain and grow a business through residual income in the way of upcharging for services like procuring and renewing domain names managing hosting accounts maintaining SSLs etc. This was a wonderful concept in theory but we learned that the income generated by the upcharging was no where near enough to account for all of the challenges of dealing with website management. Some of us decided to become website service managers grew our development team and went for Wordpress Joomla Drupal or custom code as our platform. The rest of us designers decided to go a different route. We started sacrificing our design sensibilities and shoehorning our creations into self-service platforms like Weebly Wix and Squarespace. While these platforms were limited and sometime even ridiculous at least our clients could pay for their own accounts eliminating the need for the website services management component. If something happened to us—a freelancer that was killed in a car crash or an agency that closed it's doors—it wouldn't hurt our customer and their website. Sure they'd be saddened by the loss but their website would still keep functioning until they could transition to a new service provider. Then Webflow introduced Client Billing as a feature and at least for me as a freelancer that's when I decided to make Webflow my platform of choice. Now all of that creative freedom and the "no-code" promise became viable because regardless of what happened to me my client's website would continue to run without too much concern other than maybe the client overlooking an expired credit card. Now that Client Billing is going away you've reintroduced several paths for a potential for customers to lose their website. And for me that's a step backwards in the future of web design services. I don't care what happens to me but I don't want anything to hurt my customer's business through the inadvertent loss of their website. What can happen? We don't know yet but the loss of Client Billing makes things messy again. If we want to build our own "client billing" feature we have to introduce a third party to our customers and third-parties we're learning are not always dependable and may not be around as long as you need them. (Think Wordpress Plugin developers or Flowdock.) So the best option for us web designers is not to re-introduce the pitfalls of website management back into our client relationships in the way of "client billing." The best option is to have our customers pay for their own Webflow hosting and for us to manage their website settings for them. Webflow what you should do is simply create the ability for site plans to have two site administrators more might be better for some agencies but all we need is two the account owner and one other designated administrator. That's all we need just one additional super user. Just make it so this super user can't edit the billing information or hosting plan level. That's it! The funny thing is that you know that you've been holding off on doing this for a very long time in the interest of revenue generated by the complex hosting team and account plans you've set up. But if you're planning on focusing your efforts on maintaining the best web builder out there then give us a new simple super user and let us get on with designing. ,06/04/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4965

WEBFLOW-I-6036,Enhancing Webflow Development: Efficient CSS Separation for Improved Performance,1,Hey there fellow Webflow developers!  Today I wanted to present a provocative suggestion that might greatly improve our Webflow development experience especially while working on larger projects with several collection pages. I suggest including a strong feature that would let us divide bigger CSS files into smaller ones for each page. This not only meets the demands of projects with specific page aesthetic requirements but it also offers significant performance benefits by removing the weight of extraneous code.  As developers we are aware that Webflow merges all styles into a single CSS file making development simpler and making it easier to implement wide-ranging modifications. However this method frequently results in poorer performance on the project's smaller simpler pages. These pages ultimately load a full CSS file with styles they don't need which has a negative impact on performance.  But consider giving users the option to split CSS files for different pages. This would enable us to apply stylesheets selectively depending on particular pages effectively removing the overhead of useless styles. The outcome? increased speed and quicker load times for smaller pages that don't have to support extraneous code.  Now let's dive into some compelling reasons why this feature would be an absolute game-changer: Streamlined Customization: Separating CSS files for individual pages would streamline the customization process. We could focus on fine-tuning the styling of each page without impacting the performance of simpler pages. This level of granularity would allow for greater flexibility and precision in crafting unique designs tailored to specific sections of a website. Improved Page Responsiveness: With separate CSS files we could optimize pages for responsiveness independently. Stylesheets specific to individual pages could be optimized and fine-tuned to ensure seamless user experiences across different devices. This feature would be particularly beneficial for projects where certain pages require unique layouts or intricate responsive behavior. Code Organization and Maintenance: Having separate CSS files for each page promotes better code organization and maintenance. It simplifies locating and updating styles specific to a particular page making our lives as developers much easier. We can work more efficiently focusing only on the relevant code instead of navigating through a large consolidated stylesheet. Faster Iterations and Prototyping: During the iterative design process separating CSS files would enable faster prototyping and experimentation. We could isolate specific pages apply changes and test them without impacting the rest of the project. This agility accelerates the design iteration cycle and improves overall productivity. We would have the ability to empower ourselves to optimize our projects for better speed responsiveness and code organization if Webflow had the option to split CSS files for each pages. It guarantees that every page performs to its maximum capacity regardless of complexity which is a developer's dream come true.,29/05/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-6036

WEBFLOW-I-3675,Loading options for Lottie Animations.,33,It'd be great to have the same loading options you get for images for lottie animations.  One thing preventing me from creating cool lottie animations is the fact the page loads before the lottie animation has a chance to fully load.

WEBFLOW-I-1558,Symbol Variables,60,Symbols in Webflow are fantastic and in widespread use. The ability to pass in variables to Symbols would increase their use cases immeasurably here some examples:1. Within a Collection TemplateGiven I have collections called "Products" "Basic Pages" and "Blog Articles" I would like to display Products relating to the content within individual Basic Pages or Blog Articles.Basic Pages and Blog Articles can multi-reference Products via "Related Products".I create a symbol called "Related Products" containing a Products collection list. Within the Symbol settings I can add a named variable called "products" and set it's value requirement to a field-type of multi-reference. Within the collection templates for Basic Pages and Blog Articles I place the Related Products symbol in the sidebar and set the variable to use data from the "Related Products" field in each instance.Now when I update the structure of the "Related Products" symbol it updates across both collection templates (like a current symbol) but uses dynamic data from individual collection items within two different collections.2. Used in conjunction with Global Variables per SiteI have a global variable called "Phone Number".I have a navbar symbol containing a click to call link.  Within the Symbol settings I can add a named variable called "Phone Number" and set it's value requirement to the Global Variable.When I copy and paste this symbol to another site Webflow backend voodoo checks if the symbols variable requirements exist and if not asks me if I would like to create a Global Variable called "Phone Number".,07/11/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1558
WEBFLOW-I-274,Allow interactions to be grouped,83,I have a website which uses a huge amount of animations on each page. Keeping track of all the animations in a single pane is cumbersome. Can we therefore add functionality to group interactions allowing us to organise interactions.  Currently I have to name animations by page (HP hero fade-in as an example) and then organise them all in order.

There are many tools out there for tracking hours. (For example... a watch.) But could there be a way to implement this into Webflow itself? For example time is automatically tracked as soon as you start a project. You can view how much time you've spent developing at any time in the project settings.

WEBFLOW-I-4694,Remove search results page after it has been added,20,My wishlist item is to be able to delete the search page or at least set it to draft status. Once a utility page such as the search page is created for a project the page (by adding a search element to a page) then the page cannot be removed from the project. This page was automatically created in my project when I added the search bar to a page to try it out. I later decided not to include it on the website but the search results page can now not be deleted. The reasons this would be useful are: • To avoid google & other search engines indexing that unused page • To avoid people visiting the page - Since a 301 redirect in project settings is not possible for existing published pages • To hide it from editors who I have invited to collaborate • To satisfy my desire to keep my Webflow project neat and tidy  There are some workarounds I have been provided by the very helpful Webflow support staff I haven't tried them as the main reason I want to delete it is to hide it completely from my client to avoid questions. However they may be helpful to someone else so I'll list them here: To avoid search engines indexing the page when crawling such as when crawling the sitemap.xml file I could try a meta noindex tag in the head code for that page - https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/block-indexing#meta-tag. To avoid visits: Try location.replace code in the header of the page. Here is a screenshot example of using this on another page in a project - https://cln.sh/uxkky9GlWFMbEVOldmES.  To hide it from editors: There's no workaround however if the collaborator was to click on the page it should not allow them to edit a search page from within the Editor but show a "For now the Editor is not available on this page." message.,02/12/2021,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4694

Even better: to be able to select an alternative animation for it in case the animation manipulates crucial content (e.g. accordions). ,31/05/2020,Planned,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2900
WEBFLOW-I-5235,WebP compression for CMS items,11,Currently WebP compression can only be done in the image library. Images stored in CMS items can not benefit from this new awesome feature.

WEBFLOW-I-1042,Ability to host more file types,70,Limited file hosting is the primary reason I can't make the switch from SiteGround (hosting + WordPress) to Webflow (hosting + designer) for hosting my personal site. If there's somewhere in Webflow where I can upload audio files like .mp3 .wav or .m4a files I can't find it.

WEBFLOW-I-1288,Drop-shadow filters.,64,Adding a shadow to an image with an alpha channel using the `box-shadow` property doesn't wrap the shadow around the transparent parts of the image. Instead we just get a square box shadow. In order to make the shadow wrap naturally around the contours of the image we need to use `filter: drop-shadow(x y blur spread color)`.

WEBFLOW-I-1280,Disable Google Fonts / serve jQuery and other scripts directly from Webflow,64,Disregarding the huge advantages of CDNs it would be really great if the Webflow project settings allowed to: 1) disable the call to ajax.googleapis.com completely and instead serve the fonts from uploads-ssl.webflow.com (or allow to add them manually via CSS base64 encoded) 2) load jQuery from uploads-ssl.webflow.com instead of code.jquery.com (or even allow to disable it if it is not used) 3) load html5shiv.(min).js from uploads-ssl.webflow.com instead of Cloudflare 4) load placeholders.(min).js from uploads-ssl.webflow.com instead of Cloudflare  Reasons why I put this on the wishlist: - To comply with EU-GDPR those responsible for running a website hosted on webflow have to make sure that any third party that may come in contact with personal data (and according to the ECJ this includes IP addresses as well) have a DPA in effect with the website owner. Webflow already offers such a DPA. So do Google and Cloudflare but jQuery.com for example does not. - Regardless some may just like to keep the text of their privacy policy way shorter by not having to mention so many third parties. - Furthermore in some cases the access to certain CDNs like code.jquery.com may be blocked like in China. - If you use custom webfonts and a generic fallback you don't need to load all the Open Sans variants that are being loaded by default  Thank you for your consideration! :-),26/05/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1280

WEBFLOW-I-2934,Saving Nested Collections as Symbols,38,I understand collection nesting is a newer feature and hopefully this is already well into development but it would be great if there was the ability to utilize symbols with nested collections in them. I am currently working on a site where I have built out a site-map in the CMS that can be referenced on the main navigation dropdowns and footer. The plan was for the dropdowns to be built as a nested collection within the main site navigation but with that solution I can no longer save it as a symbol to be used across the site.,09/06/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2934

The company sells single classes and bundles of 5 10 or 20. I can create these bundles as separate products but it would be great to have a discount applied for different volume levels.

Essentially whenever I click deploy it should create a new entry in the revisions in the designer and allow me to make some comments about the release. If a make a bunch of changes it would also be nice to only add certain changes to the deploy. For example I might update my contact page.. and then head over to my home page to change something. But for this specific release I just want to deploy that contact page change. I should be able to see those changes in my sidebar pane and select only the ones I want to add them all to a staging area... Then when I click deploy (whether to staging .webflow.io domain or to production .com domain) it will deploy only those changes I've selected and are in the staging area. The other changes would remain changed in the designer even when I log out and come back in.. but they are not live on the deployed URL. This would be really great for change management.

WEBFLOW-I-5703,Be able to set animations on all pages automatically,7,I feel like this is probably quite a common issue for a lot of people as I run in to it constantly. There’s still no way to apply a page load/page scroll animation across every page of a site with large sites this can be quite a task to deal with manually. For example I frequently have to do a fixed navbar background colour change animation so that text is legible rather than lost in body elements/text. At the moment I have to make sure that every page has the animation applied to it. This makes it incredibly easy for there to be mistakes when edits have to be made. For example maybe there’s another animation on mobile that gets decided later in a project and I have to go through every single page to disable the original animation then add in the new mobile animation. This could lead to duplicate or missing animations across pages and just overall confusion in the project. It would be much better if we could apply these animations across all pages especially when components are involved.  I feel like this would be best implemented as another section under page animations by splitting it into "this page animations" and "all page animations",30/11/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5703

Right now there is no way to select the "Tresbox" class while working in the tablet breakpoint. The designer only offers to go back to the desktop breakpoint.

This is possible today but you are still publishing an empty detail page since the article links to another website. In this case it would be great to have the option to "disable collection item detail page" and no detail page for this specifik item is created. Example: The clients want to add or delete pricing rows:We could create a CMS collection called pricing rows and in the setting we could set "disable all detail pages". Then the client can use the CMS collection to add delete or change content. Example: Ability for client to add delete or edit Main Navigation Links.Lets say the client want to have the ability to add delete and edit the main navigation on the website. We could create a collection called "Pages" or "Navigation". We could either disable all detail pages and use the collection to create the main navigation and let clients add delete or edit nav links. In a simple site we could create the collection "pages" and the client can easily add delete or edit all pages through one collection. If the client adds a new item it would create a new nav link in the main navigation and a new collection page.

We also need zapier zaps that enable use of zapier most advanced actions. As it stands webflow ecommerce can not be readily / properly integrated with POS shipping accounting review and other platforms. Some examples of current limitations which apply to both zapier and direct use of api: - No SKU is generated in the "purchased items" child array of orders requests made by the api or in zapier. - So we can't create integrations when new products / SKU inventory are created. - we can't create ecommerce products via zapier. Or it is not documented. I try to use the create item  action but it creates a record that crashes webflow designer.

WEBFLOW-I-2253,cloud.typography support,42,This feature would not be used by as many folks as the Google fonts or Typekit integration but it would attract enterprise-level clients who would require it to do their job effectively. Hoefler & Co. are the cream of the crop when it comes to type design and their legendary status is cemented every day by the global brands using their type. cloud.typography isn't fonts.com—H&Co. is a legendary foundry and cloud.typography was built for enterprise web design. It belongs on the list of integrated solutions alongside Google fonts and Typekit as a serious solution for designers and brands whose type needs to be on point. They have security measures which prevent traditional webfont downloads so they are a unique case which is just begging to be supported for serious type-obsessed designers. It is not possible to download webfonts for upload. It is also unclear if it's possible to use custom code injection to use the fonts—but the clients who are attracted to cloud.typography will more commonly be running massive operations where not having type in the designer is a non-starter. https://forum.webflow.com/t/typography-com-cloud-typography-hoefler-co-support/20150,16/09/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2253

WEBFLOW-I-2073,Ability to "lock" classes,44,Often I create utility classes such as ".text-center" ".img-right" etc but I often go back to edit an object and mistakenly edit some other property such as color or padding and it applies it to my utility class which then affects all items using that class. I know I can manually change the selector in the pane but it's just so easy to forget and overlook. For example if I had an element with .main-text | .text-center and go back later to edit the text color on the element it would add it to .text-center. It would be awesome if we could just "lock" classes or tag them as a "utility class" to prevent accidentally adding unwanted definitions to those classes on the fly. So for the example above if I were able to "lock" .text-center from being edited Webflow would instead add the definition to .main-text and not .text-center. ,06/06/2019,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2073

All we need is the ability to add an image to the button and pull the Variant Image. And for color swatches the ability to add a color picker field to the CMS item and dynamically pull it. It would be a great addition to the customization of the product page.At the moment for product image swatches i'm using a very manual workaround where i've segmented each color into a different cms item and tied the together with a multi-reference field but there are many reasons this is not optimal.Please take the variant button feature all the way to the end.,13/07/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4375
WEBFLOW-I-6030,Ability to further customize the "Additional Information" element on the checkout page.,1,This is useful in more ways than I can count and I think almost anyone looking to collect customized data upon product purchase will benefit from it greatly. Here’s how it should/could work: Keep the “Additional Information” element as an option on the checkout page. Get rid of the ability to toggle on/off the 3 options this currently limits us to and instead allow for virtually unlimited customization. Then give us the ability to conditionally hide/reveal each form element based on the product being purchased.

WEBFLOW-I-1072,Ability to set a "default" active tab in a tabs element,58,Currently the active tab can be set by clicking it in the settings panel when the tabs element is selected. However when designing I will often select other tabs to design within them and then publish the site live. This results in the non-primary tab being set as the active tab which is a mistake.

WEBFLOW-I-5916,CSS Design Tokens for spatial units (Spatial System) and typographic scale,3,I love that we have color swatches. Managing large projects and handing them over to clients in Webflow would be immensely easier if we could use similar saved values for spatial values and typography settings. Right now I'm having to set and use utility classes to manage my spatial system which has unintended side-effects.  ExampleI have set up css on a stylesheet page among which: .p-y-large{  padding-top: 32px;  padding-bottom: 32px;} .text-small{ font-size: 14px; } Now imagine I'm setting up a grid layout. I'll create a Grid and give it a class. Let's say "homepage hero grid". I set the grid to the number of columns I want.Aside: I have to hard-code the grid gap value into the individual grid. Not great in case I want to re-use the component in a different project that has different spatial system values.  Let's say I'm happy with the layout. I now add the p-y-lage and text-small classes to the Grid to make sure I get the effect I want. But then I decide the Grid needs a smaller grid-gap value on mobile breakpoint. I switcht to mobile breakpoint and now I have two choices: Either I leave the utility classes while making my change to the grid gap. This wil bind the new gap value to .homepage-hero-grid.p-y-large-text-small instead of just .homepage-hero-grid which is a problem if I want my code to be maintainable. My best option is to remove the utility classes from the element and commit them to my mind's short term memory make the change to the grid and then enter them again. You can see how this way of working is a hassle.  Both ways of working are a problem. How does anybody maintain their classes and design system in Webflow?  My suggestion is that the styles panel offers saved values for [type size + line height] and for margin/padding/gap values. The same could be done for border styles border-radius transitions transforms box-shadow and the like. They could all be custom properties in terms of CSS so we can flexibly change them in the front-end if need be. This would make it easy to take a design system library and adjust the look simply by changing these values.

WEBFLOW-I-4888,Bing IndexNow Text Key File Hosting,14,It would be great to have a way to host a txt key file at the root for IndexNow. This service will become crucial for everyone moving forward. Bing Yandex and others already use it and Google is currently trialing it. The service currently requires that the api key file be hosted at the root of your domain. Trying to do a redirect from root to an alternate host or to the Weblow assets folder doesn't work either as suggested in the forum for files such as ads.txt since the file can't be hosted on an alternate domain or sub-domain than the one you are trying to index. This missing feature prevents anyone from using a third-party service such as ContentKing which monitors and submits urls of changed content to IndexNow.

WEBFLOW-I-723,Lifting Limit on Max 100 items in Collection on Front-End,61,Hi I've been in touch with support about this and advised to make this a feature request. There seems to be an arbitrary limit of 100 on the number of items that can be displayed on the front-end in a collection. This poses a major headache for me and I'm sure numerous other developers in many instances where there would be more than 100. I don't for example know of any Blogs or News feeds or other archives that would want to be limited in this way. Right now I'm going to have to hack this issue by using multiple instances of a collection on the front end with ranges From - To and this is pretty shoddy and requires continued updates. To me this seems like a simple system update to remove the limit and give an option for -1 records (like WordPress etc) and it's something that Webflow needs to be doing Now. Once updated this will also pave the way for Webflow collection pagination which is something I know is 'being worked on'.

WEBFLOW-I-339,Add a cheaper CMS hosting for small business sites,63,Webflow CMS feature is great and I like it a lot however the CMS hosting price is way to expensive for small business owners Maybe in the segment of big businesses the price is reasonable when you want to use SSL have a great uptime etc. but for small sites like local coffee shop or a private yoga teacher all that is not needed. I would love to have $5 to $7 hosting for smaller businesses. Just right now I am working with clients and for both of them it is too expensive so I have to implement custom mail form scripts deprive my clients from a perfect CMS and host elsewhere using Webflow only as a visual web builder.  Effectively Webflow looses a hosting client as well in that case.

WEBFLOW-I-5323,Feat. Request: Invoices automatically send by mail to the billing email address,8,I have the possibility to set up a billing email address in the invoice settings of the workspace. So I receive the receipts but not the invoices via email. So it's a little bit annoying because someone of the financial team has to log in once a month and manually download the invoice.

I then go back to the Collection Page remove the dynamic bindings - copy and paste - then redo the dynamic bindings. It'd be nice if there was a right click option to copy without dynamic bindings.

WEBFLOW-I-3204,Add Font Clamp to font size options.,28,Using vw units is helpful when scaling websites but can sometimes present design challenges. font-size:clamp() allows you use a range of font-sizes using other units in conjunction with vw units so you wouldn’t have to adjust font-sizes all the way down (though you still could).

WEBFLOW-I-3768,Remove unused font families from code,24,There is an ongoing issue with the code Webflow producess. Once a Font family has been added is appears in the code regardless if you have removed the family from all classes and don't utilise it on your site. There is no way to remove these font families or track if they are showing in your code. It makes a small difference to percormance sure but often a few extra miller sec off a load time can make all the difference.

WEBFLOW-I-2175,Truly Custom Ecommerce Transactional Emails,37,Current e-commerce transactional email customization options are super limited. I want more flexibility to change the layout design and content of the email. If the webflow designer can't support it at the very least I'd like to drop in my own code.

WEBFLOW-I-2581,Self-Hosted CMS with own Database like Wordpress,32,If we could use the CMS on our own Servers (install Webflow on our own Databases) like we can do so with Wordpress Webflow could become the number one CMS!

WEBFLOW-I-1872,More Ecommerce Sorting Options,41,The ability to sort by number of items shipped would be great for a popular collection list or related items list that are popular.

WEBFLOW-I-3466,Smooth scrolling and page snapping,25,I would love for Webflow to come with smooth scrolling and page snapping options because I think it adds to a cleaner and more user friendly site.

WEBFLOW-I-624,Upload multiple images to Lightbox,58,As a photography who wants to display images in galleries it seems absurd that the Lightbox widget will only allow the user to add one image at a time and no batch adding.  A wedding that has 600 images makes Lightbox commercially a non starter.  I find I am using Adobe Lightroom to export a slideshow /  gallery into Webflow.  I would  much rather complete this task with the prepared images in Webflow.,13/04/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-624
WEBFLOW-I-4676,Click to Enlarge Image (or Lightbox!) in CMS Rich Text,15,Wordpress has a feature where when you upload an image into CMS Rich Text you can select "No Link" "External Link" or "Full Size".

WEBFLOW-I-5740,⚠️ A pricing plan between "Free" and "Basic" like Framer,5,Just a thought and I think it's a good one: Have a plan betwen "Free" and "Basic" like Framer does.  ⚠️ I'd recommend looking at Framer's product and pricing before forcing all those grandfathered in to start paying 15$/month for those 1-page splash pages: https://www.framer.com/pricing/ ....guessing pushing designers to more designer-friendly tools that also align with tools that they are already use to using like Figma is the last thing you want to do.  9 months (when forced to pay higher pricing) is just enough time to move some of those 1-page splash pages on Webflow over to Framer while telling friends currently using Webflow how awesome and easy Framer is to use. Lol  I kid mostly. But I'm guessing it is a good idea to know who your competition is and how you compare both in terms of features and pricing before raising/changing pricing 😉 ,12/12/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5740
WEBFLOW-I-1398,Customisable & self-hosted Video Player,45,It would be very cool to have a custom video player where self-hosted and/or embedded videos could be implemented inside of Webflow.

WEBFLOW-I-1529,Cancel plan or hosting subscription and retain the service period you payed for,43,Scenario: I want to quit hosting or account plan but I want to retain the period I payed for.  How it should work: If I remove the payment method from account current services will automatically terminate in the end of payed period. or To have an option (button) to cancel further recurring payments. How it works now: Currently when I cancel hosting plan it terminates immediately. I cannot remove payment method when plans are active. If I want to cancel without loosing money I have to put reminder and cancel manually on due date.  Benefits: This would make it easier to set up time limited projects and prevent unwanted recurring payments.,26/10/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1529
WEBFLOW-I-1857,Change element type in style editor,40,Drop down at the top of the style editor to be able to change the type of element say from a Div to a Link block whilst keeping any relevant style options.

WEBFLOW-I-2635,Integration with cloudflare's proxy,30,I have multiple clients that I've migrated over to webflow from wordpress or squarespace. All have many platforms used to make their app function: Shopify BigCommerce or custom SaaS. I put webflow on 'www' subdomain and run their apps on naked. Some have other subdomains as well. These companies have links all over the place and I consolidate redirects in cloudflare.  Additionally I'll run promos to the same vanity url. Ie: we're selling a premium seasonal box: "htttp://domain.com/2020-april-shower" During the period of selling this box I'll redirect traffic in the following manner: Before the sale -> '/2020-april-shower/waiting' - a countdown timer until the launch date During the sale -> '/2020-april-shower/open' - sales page After the sale -> '/2020-april-shower/last-chance' - a last chance offer for anyone who still clicks on the original vanity link Once stock is low or out -> '/another-link' - redirect to the homepage non sale offer of the item or something else. For this above example I need to use 302's and not 301s (only redirect option from webflow). Additionally I'd rather not give everyone on the team access to webflow.  Every 90 days I get a 525 SSL handshake failed error from cloudflare to webflow. As I understand it this is due to the plan webflow has with Let's Encrypt for issuing certificates. If there is no permanent solution for this could we get a "renew cert" button that would cause the SSL error but it would be controlled and I could fix it immediately. Adding 302s in webflow is not a solution I desire - webflow is a great page building platform stick with what it does best and let cloudflare handle the redirects.,06/03/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2635
WEBFLOW-I-293,A way to return how many items there's in a collection,58,A feature for us to print the number of items in a collection wherever we want in a collection list a collection page or static page. It could be useful to design bubbles or indicators showing how many items exist for a given list. It's more precise than for a collection. It would be affected by the limitations of a list. For example a list of 3 first blog posts filtered to category: international with an indicator in the title of the list showing how many items that list returns when you click a "Show all" link. I don't fully envision how this would work because this indicator would have to be outside of the list actually along with the title of the list. It's not a dynamic data per se rather a metric from the CMS. It goes along the pagination feature and maybe the manual sorting of a collection:,30/01/2017,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-293
WEBFLOW-I-4891,Last-child CSS selector supported natively,12,Many Webflow designers have to create combo classes to remove the bottom margin from last-child elements. This is the most common use case and there are more. Supporting the last-child selector natively could speed up the building process and would be a great addition to Webflow in my opinion.,26/02/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4891

WEBFLOW-I-936,External Data Source for Collection List,51,It would great if you could query an external API to retrieve some data that can be returned in JSON or XML.  This result set could be data bound to the collection list. It is really nice to be able to layout the visual aspects of the collections list and have it "repeat" for the underlying data set.  There are situations where a user has external systems that support their business and being able to pull data from those system and display the content on a Webflow site. The idea is to NOT have to repeat the data in two places by setting up a collection inside the Webflow CMS and either manually enter it or write custom code to connect to the Webflow API to manage the Webflow CMS collections.  Many of these systems already have a way through JQuery/Ajax to query the data and return a JSON data set.,09/10/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-936

Make it as vague as you need quarterly or yearly overview but at least give us a hint on when to espect a feature. For example user accounts.

WEBFLOW-I-5791,controlling the visibility on page elements based on the user,4,This is for memberships (beta). At the moment the customer needs to be sent to a separate gated-page for each of their course purchases since page-level gating is the only option at this time (which means I create dashboard A for course A and dashboard B for course B and if the customer bought both then they'll have 2 dashboards). However Memberships does not have an inbuilt feature that supports conditional redirects based on a customer's purchase history. Which means I need to add also 2 log in buttons (one for dashboard A one for dashboard B) and if you purchased both you'll log in twice...

Right now I can only filter by showing items based on "Today." This seems to show all posts for today and earlier regardless of time. Editors need to be able to publish blog posts at specific times.

You could create a form with a photo or other file upload option hook that up to a Logic Flow and you will have another CMS item page with your blog and including the image/photos.

"French" would be a field in the collection item* NEW! "Goldilocks" could also be a field in the collection item And I could choose the structure for my URLs in the collection settings.

WEBFLOW-I-1406,Add file attachment (PDF PPT Images etc) field type to the editor for non-dynamic content!,39,Consistency for file attachments in the editor for clients would be nice and extremely useful!  I feel like Webflow can sometimes forget about how important these features are for other pages and content too that are not dynamic. For example if my client wants to change their Open Graph image on the Home Page or any page for that matter they can't do it. They have the ability to do so on dynamic pages but not on other pages which baffles me. It's just inconsistent. For example I have to explain to clients now "yes for blog pages you can change the OG image yourself but for the other pages (like home page maybe) you're going to have to upload that somewhere else and paste the link instead." Lol. A client who is paying for hosting $20+/mo in my opinion should have the option to simply upload assets/content through the editor themselves (images resumes etc.) so the web designer already has the content there (in the assets manager) to work with. It can prolong the workflow going back and forth with a client to email me images and other content to upload for them (through the Designer) when something like this could easily be done by the client through the editor. This is commonly part of the job but now clients/users have these options with dynamic content so all I'm saying is why are we forgetting about non-dynamic content/pages like it's any less important or useful?! I hope Webflow can add this feature to all sensible areas in the editor!,23/08/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1406
WEBFLOW-I-5455,Improve sustainability of digital services created with Webflow,6,Web sustainability is an essential topic which the W3C started working on : https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/ Some element can also be found here : https://sustainablewebdesign.org  Webflow is offsetting its carbon emissions but there is much more to do by reducing them in the first place. There could be courses or lessons on the Webflow online university (https://university.webflow.com) to help creators understand sustainability best practices. Webflow could also implement efficiency best practices and encourage sobriety for creators through nudges and guidelines. Raising awareness on this topic is an important step to take. For example this could be implemented through a Carbon Website Calculator Badge : https://www.websitecarbon.com/badge/  Either I think sustainability should get more attention and discussion to help Webflow and creators reduce the environmental impacts of websites created thanks to this amazing tool.   ,26/09/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5455
WEBFLOW-I-4668,Ability to copy dynamic elements from CMS pages and paste them somewhere else,13,Lets say I have the perfect layout prepared for my CMS blogpost or a category. For the sake of consistency of my website I would like to copy the entire layout paste it to one of my other pages and modify it as much as I need to.  When I try to do so I get the usual "Dynamic elements can only be moved withing the same Collection List or Collection Page".  As a workaround I have to unlink all of the dynamic elements from my CMS page one by one copy the entire layout reverse all of the unlinking (because I dont want to break my original CMS page) quickly switch to the other page and paste it there.  Could it please automatically unlink all of the dynamic elements when I try to copy+paste them somewhere else and replace it with the usual "lorem ipsum" AND give me a warning that you had to unlink the copied dynamic elements instead of a warning that I cannot do this at all?

We would like to be able to assign more than one team admin at a minimum and be able to decouple the billing from an admin account if needed.

WEBFLOW-I-6005,Derivative Fields or Meta/social sharable Image Generators from CMS,1,Background: The website I run has a CMS collection. For each page in the collection the hero image has a transparent icon in the hero image. The background color changes to reflect the item's rating. However for the meta-image/social sharable image I need to regenerate the image from scratch: setting it against a background sizing and aligning it and adding our logo to the bottom right. While my current solution is to use a custom Python code to generate images for each new entry I suspect that a feature like this should be easy for Webflow to implement and offer. Even though the main use case I'm imagining is for meta images I'm calling this idea derivative fields or child fields in case additional use cases are possible. Basic Idea: In a CMS you could take an existing image field and create a derivative or child image. The child image is a template composed of the parent image and additional assets or attributes. You can set a background from say other color fields in the CMS. You could choose if or where the logo would be displayed on the child image. Importantly this child image would be applied for the entire CMS. It would change dynamically for each entry in that collection. The image would occupy the same location(s) as specified. The logo any type and so forth would appear in all the child images. These derivative/child images could also be used like any other image on the site itself. Users also wouldn't be locked in to using child images if they want to use another image.,10/05/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-6005

WEBFLOW-I-5203,Support for Display-P3 LCH and LAB color swatches with sRGB fallback,7,Add support for CSS4 colors that are more engaging than what we have now. When designing with webflow we are currently limited to sRGB colors. The P3 or display-p3 color space has 26% more colors and is supported on many modern displays especially on smartphones from all manufacturers and all Apple devices. Wide-gamut (p3 LCH and LAB) colors allow us to design with colors that pop and act as showstoppers in an sRGB web. I believe Webflow should add support for P3 colors (with sRGB fallbacks for legacy support) as per the definition of the W3Cs CSS4 Color Module. The attached file shows the same website in sRGB and in P3. If your screen does not support P3 you might not see a difference or your browser will scale the sRGB colors down relative to the P3 colors. The latter option will allow you to see the difference but you will still not see the additional colors.,26/07/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5203
WEBFLOW-I-5200,Make it easier to connect a domain by integrating w/ Entri,7,You have to configure DNS records manually in order to connect a domain to a Webflow site. A couple of years ago this was a pretty tolerably and unavoidable part of building a website.  But now Entri exists and if Webflow used it on its back-end users would never have to configure their own DNS records. Domain setup could take place in just a couple of clicks and agencies would never again have to hound their clients for their DNS provider login details (which of course they can never remember).

WEBFLOW-I-5599,True Alphabetic Sort Order in CMS Collections,5,I chose to sort my collection items in alphabetical order. Webflow support pointed out that alphabetic sorting will be in this order: Numerically (keep in mind that even if your number is 10 it will sort by the "1" first) Uppercase letters alphabetically Lowercase letters alphabetically Characters with diacritics (a diacritic is a sign such as an accent or cedilla that is written above or below a letter to indicate different pronunciation) In my opinion it does not make sense to list a collection item starting with "B" before another starting with "a" just because one is written with a small vs. a capital letter. In German language we also have special characters such as ö ü ä etc. They should be listed in the alphabet like A a Ä ä B b ... instead of listing all collection items starting with a special letter at the end of the list.

WEBFLOW-I-4074,Wrap elements in a div with Cmd+G,17,Just like in Figma Sketch or Illustrator grouping elements by putting them in a Div Block with a keyboard shortcut of Cmd+G would be a lifesaver. Saving billions of nanoseconds (right Grimur?) and making Webflow Designer more intuitive. Now you have to: add a Div Block select any of the elements that you wish to put within the Div Block drag them inside.  Time-consuming especially for multiple elements.Obviously due to classes inheritance and specificity elements after grouping in a Div Block probably would change their appearance and position on the page but that's to be expected when wrapping elements in a Div manually anyways.  Same goes to ungrouping perhaps there could be a Cmd+Shift+G keyboard shortcut. And then either a modal/popup or an Option (Alt) option to preserve appearance while ungrouping/un-Div-ing/extracting elements from Divs,20/03/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4074

WEBFLOW-I-1123,Optimize web font loading code to improve load time and Google Page Speed score,40,Hi it would be great if Webflow could take the advice of the Google Page Speed tool and optimize the loading of certain assets specifically web font loading snippets. With some hand coded sites I've seen significant improvements in page load time by optimizing font loading scripts either by late loading them or at least moving them out of the <head> of the page so they aren't render blocking. Perhaps there could be a global site setting for initial display font (the one that gets displayed with the web font is loading) as well. One of our Webflow developed sites is getting a 48 mobile page speed score which as you probably know is not good. The desktop site where load time optimizations aren't as crititcal gets an 82 score.  Thanks!,15/02/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1123

WEBFLOW-I-777,Vue.js friendly attributes (which would also be friendly with other frameworks like Angular),44,Webflow is already usable with Vue.js which means you can indeed build one-page dynamic web apps. And with the addition of something like Google's Firebase for database and authenticity (secure login) functionality the sky's the limit. But I find half of my Vue binding has to be done via the custom embed and although it's not impossible it's definitely inconvenient as I'm a designer at heart and only code where needed. For instance I can add the attribute v-on:input to an element but the Webflow UX doesn't let me add @input (same result but shorthand) or v-on:input.once. I think you can really push a partnership between Webflow and Vue and answer half the app build request on the wishlist while doing so if this little change is done. I know this feature is for validation purposes but if you made an exception for any string starting with 'v-' '@' or ':' then you could still have the same damage control for pure designers while allowing developers free reign.

WEBFLOW-I-3199,Add Stripe payment field option in Form elements,21,This would be useful for those that create forms on websites that would require a payment to complete the form. It would minimize the need to embed code snippets from Stripe Checkout. (I've attached the kind of form field that can be used. Webflow already use this for there own payments)  It would also simplify the process of receiving payments without the need of too much info (eg donations or payments for a service etc).  I believe many would find this useful if they are just starting out and don't have knowledge of using Stripe API or using the Stripe Checkout.  In the settings for the element you can set the amount for the payment or allow the use of user-generated choice for donation etc.  Having this as a form field would also allow you to complete a form submission with a payment. This will show as a payment field or whatever the Webflow creator chooses to name the field. And the confirmation will be either success or failed.  In addition completion of the form with a payment can redirect to a custom successful or failed payment page followed by transactional emails similar to what can be done with the e-commerce option already available.,09/08/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3199

This feature is essential for blog/essay-style content. Readers want to check sources for credibility without having to manually scroll to the bottom of the page and then find their place in the text again. Custom code tools such as Refokus' rich-text-enhancer allows you to emulate this system in a very crude sense by adding [#id] links within the rich-text but this is incredibly time-consuming especially for longer articles with lots of references.,26/01/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5826

WEBFLOW-I-2919,Notification system for the automatic switching to larger desktop breakpoints,22,I love the addition of larger breakpoint however I often find that the designer moves to the larger breakpoint automatically without notification. When this happens all the styles I've created do not apply to the base breakpoint thus resulting in me having to completely start over and rebuild all the styles in the base break point then reset them in the larger breakpoint that they were originally applied in.  I believe this happens when resizing the browser window itself (not the designer window) however there should be a better system of indicating which breakpoint you are in or when the browser size automatically switched between breakpoints. This will save time and frustration in the event that you are in the wrong desktop breakpoint.  This has happened to me often enough where I constantly check which breakpoint I am in before I start working and STILL it has happened. I am urging Webflow to create some kind of colored banner or notification box in the top right corner (like the one you get when you copy & paste across projects) to indicate that you are in a larger desktop breakpoint than the base breakpoint!,04/06/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2919

I had no need for 3D or product design so that section in the middle kinda killed my momentum and motivation. I had a ton of trouble installing the Cinema 3D software and the Octane plugin figuring out which versions would work etc. The only one that ended up working on my 2015 MacBook Pro did not have the same interface or features as the course. This whole 3D section seems like a completely different course that derails what the course sounds like it should be.So I basically stopped in the middle and haven't gone back. I know it could skip that section and just use the rendered files but that is not the point.

Although with this said I would suggest that imported CSS libraries be exempt from "style cleanup" as they all ought to stay present even if unused at the current moment... except potentially at the moment of export.,29/12/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1696

Any discount would be an item of the collection.  Why : Discounts are super painful to maintain when you have >10K users and it's a full time job to adjust the amount / the new discounts of the new users each morning. We're using them for :1. the referral program (a code XXXX gives a user A 15% and our system increments +10€ the code YYYYY in our DB) the mechanics is ruled by our system and the right amount is displayed on the front end but it can't be automatically updated.2. new members created via memberstack have access to 2 discount codes (the referral code to share and the one they can apply to redeem their reusable containers + when they referred someone).

For example if you have a portfolio site with various projects and also a blog there's no way to sort posts from either CMS; instead they're just listed in what appears to be a random order.

Dumb quotes look like this: ' and  " Smart quotes look like this: ‘’ and “”  Proper typography requires the use of smart quotes. Many writing apps such as Microsoft Word Apple Pages and Google Docs automatically convert dumb quotes to smart quotes. Webflow does not. To get the proper typography requires first writing content elsewhere and then pasting it into Webflow—or manually inserting smart quotes every time.  That is tedious.

WEBFLOW-I-4063,Ability to set aspect ratio of images (e.g. 16:9) in the Designer,15,When creating layouts I often need to force the aspect ratio of the images (think: blog listing). The uploaded images can be any aspect ratio but to keep the grid neat and tidy I'd want to set them to all display at 16:9 or 4:3 or anything that suits the design. Here's the workaround I usually do:https://forum.webflow.com/t/how-to-auto-crop-cms-collection-list-images-16-9-aspect-ratio-example/86360 This works fine but it'd be great to have a setting for it. I'd imagine in the Elements setting panel for images. For this use case I'm not suggesting cropping just controlling the aspect ratio of the image. I understand the issue is that it requires adding extra content to the page (e.g. div block wrapper) which might be against the spirit of Webflow.  ,18/03/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4063

WEBFLOW-I-5781,Upgrade CMS with sections components or modules created by the designer that clients can add remove or reorder,3,At the moment CMSs like Dato Contentful and even Wordpress with Elementor appear more modern because they allow developers to create modular components/symbols for clients to then easily add fill in and reorder on any page. In contrast it takes a lot of time to customize collection pages in Webflow to create an interesting layout. We also end up with an excessively long and messy form for the client to fill out due to the fact that if we want to create different layouts for a same collection of articles for example the form needs to be the same and so show all the possible choices which can be limiting. It would be great to have the ability to create sections with different fields in a collection and then give clients the ability to add remove or reorder those sections. A simpler solution would be to create tabs in a collection form which would allow designers to create different layouts that can be used by clients. For now I am starting to tell my clients that Webflow may not be the best choice for anything other than static websites or very simple blogs. It's making me sed because I really love the power that Webflow gave me as a designer ❤️,04/01/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5781
WEBFLOW-I-4298,Robustify Webflow's image resizing method to detect and properly treat auto-rotation based on exif data,13,BACKGROUND Sometimes digital images taken upside down or 90 degrees sideways contain exif data that allows photo viewers (including web browsers) to show the image right side up. This means you cannot tell if an image is truly right side up just by viewing it on Windows Photo Viewer etc. unless you somehow ignored the exif data. PROBLEM When uploading images to Webflow the current backend process saves a full-size version (with all the exif data included) as well as two downsized thumbnails. The latter are created by resizing the original without taking into account any exif data. Therefore if the original was actually not upright the two thumbnails will not be upright either even though the full-size upload will show up correctly (since it still contains the exif auto-rotation data). SOLUTION Modify the image upload method to include the following steps: Before upload strip the full-size image of exif data. Display preview of image and allow users to correct rotation. Either rotate image in the front-end and upload or upload image with rotation instructions. Continue with current resizing routine.

WEBFLOW-I-79,Easier Billing Maintenance,40,I have a professional account and I manage our companys account with four seats. It would just be nice to be able to easily combine the two and have all billing info in one place. Also be able to set up an email to get invoices sent to a specific address. Today we have 4-6 invoices scattered over a month: no system and very hard to keep track. It is hard to see if I have what I should have or if I am paying too much.,18/01/2017,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-79
WEBFLOW-I-544,Ability to use SASS in the custom code area,39,Whilst Webflow is being upgraded it would be a good interim to support the use of SASS within the CSS custom code area. The SASS can just be compiled into the page on publishing/exporting the code. It would definitely tidy up the custom code and make it more manageable to style children elements based on their parent class etc. I know this can be achieved with CSS alone but it is far less manageable! Global swatches could be referenced within the SASS as an added bonus!,12/03/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-544

Such a combination is contradictory. It would be awesome if we could exclude pages from the sitemap. Also it's a problem that all pages in the auto-generated sitemap are non-canonical URLs - please fix that.

We end up with a lot design assets in Canva that we need to download and then reupload for publishing. it would be great if there was a way to import canva designs into Webflow and avoid the download and reupload process. There are two ways I can see this being beneficial... When you click on an an image element in the Webflow designer it would give you an option to select a design from your Canva account If there was a way to include a link to a Canva design in a CSV file so that it could be imported into a collection.

WEBFLOW-I-4879,Sitemap Index With Collection-Based Sub Sitemaps,8,For sites with large sitemaps and continually updating content (like news or blog sites) it would be helpful to have content/collection based sub-sitemaps and have a parent sitemap index. Most e-comm and news sites use this technique to help Google crawl relevant content updates more speedily and re-submit sitemaps when content is updated.

WEBFLOW-I-2561,More Payment Processors,20,I've seen multiple posts regarding the same topic but I'm bringing it up again to hopefully get someone's attention. I would love to see more payment processors integrated into Webflow. Stripe and Paypal are very notorious for shutting larger e-commerce stores down. Authorize.net has been my payment processor for a long time with zero troubles (using a different website builder) I even asked their team to contact Webflow regarding an integration.

Thus there should be also an option on invitation to preset values that carried along the invitation process = we link correct project/s to the invitation which is then sent to a list of recipients.That was a dedicated example.

Ads.txt specifies a mechanism for publishers to list their authorized digital sellers if you are planing to monetize your website with display and or native ads it is mandatory to have an ads.txt file in the root level of your domain.  Currently the only workaround for this issue is to buy a 3rd party hosting and redirect domain-example.com/ads.txt to a new subdomain that is hosted with a 3rd party web hosting company - subdomain.domain-example.com/ads.txt.

WEBFLOW-I-511,Ability to SET the Value of a Form Field Manually (eg: hidden fields for form/script processing options),37,How/Why this would be useful: - On my Site there is a Contact Form. - The Form Script emails me the results of what was entered (using FormMail). - This Script requires that a few "hidden" fields be set for setting the script's options with the option names matching the field name and the value matching your option preference.. For Example: - What email address should the Script email the results to? (in this case you would create a hidden field specifically named 'recipient' and set the value= to whatever email address you want the form results to be sent to). - What would you like the Subject of the form submission email to be?(in this case you would do the same thing - except you would name the hidden field 'subject' and set the value= to whatever you want the subject of the email to be that you receive each time the form is submitted. ..There are of course further options as well such as being able to set the ability to have the submission email you receive contain info about the browser that the user was using when they submitted the form and more.. But I'm sure you all get the idea.. The bottom line is the ability to SET the value of a Form Field manually is not currently available in Webflow. The Issues this causes: Every single time I 'Export' my Code I must manually enter all of these hidden fields myself again and again and again and again.. It gets to be quite tedious.  So please Webflow I would greatly appreciate the addition of this ability.. Thanks! - Studio2bDesigns.com,02/03/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-511

WEBFLOW-I-3880,Add Australia to AWS DNS,14,Custom domains are slower to use than the webflow.io domain in Australia.

WEBFLOW-I-2672,Allow reCAPTCHA in multiple languages as available through Google's reCAPTCHA API & hl language codes,19,reCAPTCHA on our English URL: I'm not a robotreCAPTCHA on our Malay URL: I'm not a robot (wrong!) The Malay version should read: "Saya bukan robot". Why is it like that? Because Google's language-detection heuristics are very poor for reCAPTCHA. Instead of reinventing the wheel Google simply lets API users override the language via a two-letter hl language code passed onto the reCAPTCHA api va a JS resource parameter. The problem is that Webflow doesn't expose any way for us to set the reCAPTCHA hl language code even when we know what language is needed. Ask your users to change their brower's language via the browser settings and then restart their browser. 😔 Yes. That is the ONLY way to force the reCAPTCHA language to change today in Webflow. This is far too much to ask for users. Many users install applications in the default English language yet browse the web in their native language. As an example your browser is in English but you can view Apple.com in Spanish. https://www.apple.com/mx/ You didn't to change your browser language. Add for us the web developer & designers a small settings area in the reCAPTCHA element to set this element's hl language code. It would be acceptable to require combo or separate classes. Anything is better than what we have today.

These element blocks could include a "connect wallet" button which would enable users to log in with their crypto wallets and access exclusive content or features as well as a "mint" button that allows users to mint NFTs directly from their website.

WEBFLOW-I-4366,Add images from collection lists to assets,11,I explained this issue in detail here: Understanding uploading images via URL / CSV  In short: images added to collection lists (via CSV) can only be used inside collection lists. If I want to use the image somewhere else (outside of an collection list) I have to upload the same image again.  It would be nice (and data saving) to automatically add images that are uploaded to collection lists in folders in the asset panel.  ,09/07/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4366

WEBFLOW-I-3966,Allow empty text fields to be edited in the Webflow Editor.,13,Currently if text fields (headings rich text text blocks text links etc) are empty they cannot be edited in the Editor.  For some text elements such as buttons and headings a pencil icon is visible - but on clicking this icon nothing happens and lots of errors pop up in the browser developer tools console.  This has been flagged as a bug elsewhere on the forums (link) and I have communicated with Support on this but they've described this as 'expected behaviour'.  It is surely not a technical limitation since the empty div remains present in the DOM with all of its Webflow data attributes and styles so the Webflow Editor should be able to recognise which empty DOM elements can be edited and which can't.  The only workaround is to bind these text fields to the CMS but this falls down on three main areas: It creates a non-intuitive experience for the client. Some fields are editable from the Editor others are editable from the CMS. It's very limited in scope - there are limitations on the number of fields collections and collection list items so larger sites will quickly run out of CMS capacity if every text field gets bound to a CMS field. It's very time consuming to set up and introduces bloat into the HTML markup.,25/02/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3966
WEBFLOW-I-3205,Is CSS calc REALLY STILL not a thing?,16,Webflow is a multimillion dollar company and I just can't fathom why they'd leave out one of the most useful tools in all of CSS and web design.

For example if I setup a few color swatches as global; webflow could include them in the CSS like this: This should be simple to implement and would open up many possibilities.

If you don't use the template you will just create blank page after blank page which then need to be 301 redirected removed from the sitemap and generally hidden in the best way possible.

WEBFLOW-I-4464,Team creators get a free seat on each Team Webflow makes more money,10,Team seats and more revenue for WebflowI think that the account owner / team creator for every team should get a free seat.  This creates an incentive for more teams to be created. I imagine you have a bunch of active webflow users who are on multiple teams who cringe when they have to buy multiple seats for themselves - one for every team they create. If you made it so the first seat is free with every team this "yuck moment" with Webflow would go away. And that means more teams would be created and more seats would be sold. Do the user research on this. I bet it's true.  I just tested this on my small little 1 person 1 team account. If I create a 2nd team and I want to be part of this 2nd team I need to create another seat for me. So now I'm paying for 2 seats for MY EMAIL ADDRESS - one for the 1st team and one for the 2nd team. This definitely feels yucky. I'm creating teams and adding seats for different people. I'm effectively acting as a revenue center for Webflow - delivering more $ to you by getting more people to use your product. And yet every time I add a team and deliver new revenue to Webflow I have to pay for the privilege of delivering more revenue to Webflow? That's completely backwards. The minute I start creating teams I am an asset and should be seen as a revenue partner not a paying client.  I believe this is a compelling argument why the account owner / team creator for every team should get a free seat.,27/08/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4464

An option to break the purple lock in other words. Sometimes you've made some very intricate design work and the bindings are everywhere and it takes a long time to unbind everything let alone identify where all the bindings are.

WEBFLOW-I-4128,Sideload images in rich text fields coming from API,12,The following is actually a bug (IMO). You can create a CMS item through the API (or Zapier) which includes a rich-text field. Webflow allows us to publish our own HTML there with images in it which is great. Though if you would edit that item after the facts from webflow it will actually break all image URL's. It seems the editor changes the image URL domain to uploads-ssl.webflow.com without actually sideloading those images. I see 2 possible solutions to this:1. Sideload the images before changing the domains. 2. Don't thinker with the image domain alltogether.

WEBFLOW-I-4583,ecommerce hosting plan - improvement ideas,9,So I have been a Webflow designer for years but am finally getting around to making an ecommerce site... ...and wow these ecommerce plans are aggravating! The "perks" are so arbitrary and repetitive. I can't believe we are limited to X $ and Y items in sales per year... This is F*!&!G CRAZY. None of these plans should limit the amount or number of sales! Sales fluctuate so much in different industries for different items not to mention you are already asking designers to jump through tons of hoops! Simply increase the transaction fees on smaller plans and reduce them on bigger plans. Getting paid more when ecommerce sites are actually working aligns Webflow with its customers (designers) needs and interests. Setting stupid arbitrary limits is disingenuous. BE MORE LIKE STRIPE https://stripe.com/pricing I can't believe that there are so many repeated items in these lists to make them look bigger.

WEBFLOW-I-2367,Allow videos to loop autoplay and hide player ui.,19,Allowing videos to loop and autoplay highlights content in a way that feels much less messy than having a Vimeo or Youtube module just plopped in middle the of the page. This is something I was able to do with Semplice and it was very convenient especially since it allowed videos to be uploaded to the CMS the same way images were — without using third party's links. The style panel could be more robust with handling videos and allow video attributes like autoplay control visibility and loop to be turned on or off. Anybody incorporating video content would benefit from showcasing videos in a clean and premium way that felt less intrusive than having a third party media player. As a videographer it's very valuable to showcase video content — things such as sizzle reels — in an elevated way.,11/11/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2367

WEBFLOW-I-5695,Asset tags and folder identification,3,This is really two ideas bundled into one.1. Folder identificationIt would be great if it was easy to identify which folder an image is in directly from the asset settings. When viewing from "all images" it's impossible to know what folder an asset belongs to without doing some digging. Simply adding this to the asset settings cards would make things worlds easier.2. Asset tagsSometimes an asset's name or folder just isn't enough for searching or finding that asset. Adding searchable tags to images would allow for better categorization of assets and would be more fluid than simply relying on an asset name or naming convention. For example an icon named lock.svg may represent "secure" or "private" or simply "lock" but only one of those terms would yield results. With tags the name can stay the same but multiple tags could be applied for greater searchability within Webflow.,28/11/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5695
WEBFLOW-I-1214,Ability to insert a static element into a collection list,27,Scenario A: Imagine a list of blog articles all controlled by a CMS collection. However within that list (let's say the 3rd item from the top) the client wants to insert a "sponsored ad" type element perhaps promoting something or even just a custom code DIV that can house an external ad. Scenario B: Imagine an agency website that has a careers page. In that page there is a grid (let's say 3 columns across) of all the current job positions available and each one links through to the job details template page. At the very end of the list there is a static "if you don't see a position for you contact us anyway" type block but the client wants it to sit *within* the grid list not as a seperate section underneath. For instance in a 3-column grid if the last job position item was sitting at #1 or #2 in the current row then the static block should sit in position #3 so it looks like it is part of the list while being static.,19/04/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1214

For example if you have specific interactions for CMS Elements with let's say changing text colors or background colors and you wanted the client to have control over their brand colors like anything else in the editor then we could set the values in the interactions to pull the color hex codes from the CMS collection color input.

I highly recommend using "Ctrl+Q" or even just "Q" because it makes way more sense as the first letter in the word "Quick" and it would be way closer to the Ctrl key making it easier to do with one hand. As of now I like many others use quick find all the time. But it has proven to be quite inconvenient when trying to pull off this shortcut with one hand. Meaning ironically the quick find command is not living up to it's name. Not only is it a hard key stoke to perform but it is also prone to error being situated so closely to other commands such as; "Ctrl+R" for page refresh and "Ctrl+D" for crating page bookmark.

WEBFLOW-I-1888,Compress webfont.js For SEO improvement,22,When using Adobe Fonts the site loads an uncompressed ajax library. This is an issue with page load times. I'm no guru on the technical side of this but I do know that uncompressed JavaScript files make the page load slower which negatively affects user experience and possibly search engine rankings.

WEBFLOW-I-4365,Make the consequences of restoring a backup more obvious,10,Recently to revert a design change we restored our Webflow site from a backup. We discovered afterwards that restoring a site changes all the collection and item IDs in the CMS. Because several of our integrations depend on these IDs many features on our site broke. Fixing them took us about five developer-days.I can see in the Webflow forum and wishlist that we aren’t alone in feeling this pain. I realize that it may not be possible to keep collection and item IDs constant when restoring a site but we wanted to recommend a few ways to prevent other Webflow users from experiencing the issue we did. The Webflow University lesson about restoring backups includes a helpful warning: “When you perform a restore all CMS Collection and item IDs will refresh.” However the warning appears at the bottom of the page and is rather subtle and easy to overlook. We recommend moving the warning to a more prominent location. When you try to restore a backup from the designer or project settings you see the following warning: “Restoring will change some of your collection IDs which may break integrations that rely on the CMS API.” This warning is helpful but insufficient. It suggests that only some collection IDs will change (not all of them) and it says nothing about item IDs. We suggest making the text here similar to the warning on the Webflow University page. Since restoring from a backup is such a destructive action Webflow users should have the option to disable this feature for specific projects. In many tools (AWS Github Vercel etc.) before executing a destructive action a user must manually type a confirmation message such as the name of the repo they’re about to delete. Webflow could implement a similar confirmation step when a user attempts to restore a backup.  I hope these suggestions are helpful!,09/07/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4365

Would be called a shared Collection.The benefit would be if we are building like a bunch of homepages for a client (because he has multiple Businesses but all are linked together) so we can grab a shared Collection and embed a custom styled CMS on every other Page.  For example: Client has two Businesses: A and B  A has some Content with CMS B has some content with CMS.  There are Job Postings which would then be shared between both these businesses. So these Jobpostings are added Once and are then displayed on page A with style A and on page B with style B.

WEBFLOW-I-4333,Customer can add personalisation to an ecommerce product,10,I am currently using Webflow to sell personalised products. One major limitation i’m facing is that customers are unable to add personalisation text on the product page. I know a lot of companies such as gifts t-shirts etc. companies would benefit from this too if they offer personalised products. This feature would allow the customer experience to become a lot smoother instead of getting them to add personalisation text on the checkout page in the notes box as sometimes they might order more than one. I am desperate for this to be a feature on Webflow I think it would be really useful.

WEBFLOW-I-4474,Ability to Schedule Updates to Already Published Posts,9,Hi Webflow Devs  During COVID times meetings events conferences concerts can often get cancelled or dates changed.  We find that out hospitality and F&B clients often need to schedule these changes to appear on existing posts - however webflow only allows scheduling to happen on new-never-published-before-posts.  So this means that to schedule a change to an existing post a client needs to duplicate the post delete the old one update the new dates (on the newly created duplicate) and then schedule - essentially creating a new post every time they want to place a schedule on previously existing posts.  As a small update to webflow: It would be great if we/clients could simply revert an existing post to 'draft' and then be able to schedule the update to the post?  As a larger update to webflow: It would be great if we/clients could somehow schedule changes to a post-as a version of the post - So essentially the post gets duplicated with the new changes. and the new version replaces the old version at the scheduled time. This way the new version can be edited separately and removed at any point if needed.  Webflow community: Let me know if this is a feature you also would find useful for your clients?

WEBFLOW-I-1623,Ask user how to proceed when pasting elements from another project,22,Currently when copying elements from one project and pasting onto another Webflow will automatically duplicate any classes that already existed and keep those on the elements instead. For example let's say in both projects A and B I had a class called "galleryImage" that was set to many images. If I copy the images in project A and paste them onto project B Webflow will automatically create class "galleryImage2" and apply it to the images I pasted. Since there is no way to batch-replace classes removing these "galleryImage2" classes from all images and then cleaning up the project is really bothersome. My suggestion: let the user decide what to do. Upon pasting a dialog should ask the user what do next: 1. Default - Create copies of every class that already exist so there is no conflict 2. Replace classes on current project with classes being pasted if they have the same name 3. Keep classes on current project applying them to objects being pasted if they have the same name.,25/11/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1623

This would enable developers to build more robust applications that interface with Webflow's CMS without having to rely on CMS fields that could change (slug name etc.) or additional API calls to retrieve the information. A current workaround is to create a Field called ItemId and copy/paste the ID in there but this falls down at scale or for production-grade applications.  Ways it could be accessed - I'll take anything!: 1. As a data attribute on the <html> tag. This currently has the pageID and siteID but no itemID :(. 2. As a value in a code embed. 3.

It would be very much appreciated that Webflow also implement such a system to give more credibility for us displaying certificates and those viewing or wanting to verify they are legitimate. Whilst I am happy to get my first certificate I put it to you that anyone seeing this can copy / paste it for themselves so it sadly lacks substance like others. I've also attached an Airtable Course Certificate I attained for reference. Please implement this feature asap.,10/04/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5954

WEBFLOW-I-1535,Filters feature for the Navigator tab,22,There are countless needs for ways to find locate isolate elements in Webflow. With the launch of the quick find bar I though we would be able to look for elements by their classname by their type or characteristic (is it dynamic or is it a trigger for an interaction...) but in fact not at all (It says "Find anything..." but I still wonder what it finds in fact). I proposed the feature but it got no attention. I also proposed to give such powers to the X-Ray mode but that didn't get much attention or love either: https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1132 So here is another proposition: a Photoshop-like Layers panel filter bar for Webflow's Navigator tab. Photoshop filter for the Layers panel is awesome. It lets you list Layers by their kind (type smart objects bitmap vector shape...) or look for them by their name or their blending mode or their smart object characteristics... it really goes in-depth and allow for maximum efficiency.   It's useful while designing it's useful to prepare files for others to work on it's tremendously useful for maintenance when you work on a file months or years after. And it would be the same for Webflow. Here's a quick mockup of the idea:  Under the drop down menu we could have access to search by name and to access more options for forms links ecommerce IX etc.,29/10/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1535

WEBFLOW-I-5812,Enable to trigger search indexing after changing/creating new item via API,2,Currently only a full-site publish triggers reindexing the site. It may be impractical though to publish the whole site each time collection items are updated via API (such as products blog posts etc.) as it could publish some work-in-progress. However until a full-site publish new items cannot be found on the site using the search feature. It would be useful to have some control over this either through some parameter or via a dedicated API call to re-index.,22/01/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5812
WEBFLOW-I-1383,Sending client billing pdf to client automatically,23,Most of my clients need the invoice for their accounting so it would be nice if the invoice pdf was sent automatically to the client.  As of now I have to send it manually to each client each month which is not a very good solution.,06/08/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1383

WEBFLOW-I-5614,Fix editor to allow editing numeric CMS fields,3,Currently the Webflow Editor does not allow clients to edit numeric fields on-page. They must go into the Collection to do it.

WEBFLOW-I-3633,Encrypted Download Links or Internal File Hosting,12,I am a new business selling digital products. Having encrypted download links with internal file hosting (e.g up to 500mb-1gb) would be perfect as most people are currently hosting their files on Google Drive or Dropbox and linking in externally.The current issue is that the download links are now easily susceptible to piracy. On desktop the download window pops up and downloads automatically but the link in the URL bar can then easily be copy and pasted and shared online. Same with mobile.Internal hosting for digital downloads would make the process a lot more secure and prevent people from sharing the link. This obviously doesn't stop people from sharing the actual file but that's another step in the chain.,02/12/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3633
WEBFLOW-I-623,Better image sizing for Rich Text,29,As of today clients can make images 50% width and then have two images on one plane. But its impossible to make that same images 100% on mobile. And the client also have to make sure the images is the exact same size. This site has a good example. I think this had to be done with a image blocks. Where you can choose a layout of the images. That solves the problem if the images is different height and width*. And the client don't have to think about mobile.  * The image block will work as a div where the images is the background. So images that is different sizes will be cropped.,13/04/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-623

WEBFLOW-I-1171,Better Favicons,24,The favicons generated by Webflow do not follow best practices anymore. They are not in the root directory where they should be for iOS devices Internet Explorer and services such as Yandex. In addition the following should be generated:- High Resolution Favicon for iOS Homescreen Web Clip (with background color and margin setting)- Favicon for Android Homescreen (with slight drop shadow similar to official Google apps)- Windows Metro Tile (white silhouette of the favicon with background color settings and Windows Metro UI options)- Safari Pinned Tabs and Touch Bar SVG icon- Customizable App Name settingA good reference and workaround for now is this Favicon Generator.,26/03/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1171

WEBFLOW-I-3229,Add Time to date conditional visibility,13,It would be useful to add time to the date/time fields for conditional visibility filters.

WEBFLOW-I-406,Display “current” class in the “states” menu,29,Adjusting settings of the current class is currently cumbersome as you need to switch back and forth between a clicked ("current" state) button and other buttons.

WEBFLOW-I-4901,Styles for Symbol Instances,6,The current symbols interface does not allow for different styles for the same symbol. For example let's say you have a button that is suitable for light backgrounds. What if you want to change the button's margin to allow for tighter spacing in a specific spot on a page but keep all the same properties of the symbol still intact (such as text link etc.)? You can't do that right now. Yes I realize this is a niche usecase but it would be really nice to have the option.,01/03/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4901

WEBFLOW-I-4505,Transfer a project with active hosting plan and custom domain,8,Hello I found that most of the times clients want to keep the live version of a Webflow project in their account rather than mine.

WEBFLOW-I-4870,Ability to replace lightbox images using the Editor,6,This is something that feels like it’s been overlooked by the webflow team.

WEBFLOW-I-3157,"Font-display: swap" toggle in settings,13,Adding a toggle in the Font settings of a project to turn the display: swap class attribute on or off. Turning it on ensures the text is visible during loading and helps with the Google PageSpeed score.  This can only be done on Webflow-side since the font classes in the CSS are always loaded *before* any custom code in the head.

Nonetheless every platform seems to lack some basic functionality in some way. And in case of Webflow it looks like its forms with 3rd party hosting. While working until now using the Webflow servers I've read the GDPR-announcement today telling me that externally hosted forms are no longer supported and that you have to implement your own code. Forms seem to be such a basic function - is it complicated to implement a solution for this? Please support externally hosted forms without the need for manual coding!  P.S.

One thing that would go a long way towards starting to cleaning up the animation UI would be if you create or select a custom animation all the other custom trigger options should disappear. This would work a lot more like when selecting a standard prebuilt animation. So it will pretty much function more like a drop down list and less like a big long list of radio buttons.

Super important for automating lists of date-bound offerings such as classes and workshops enrollment dates etc. Take for example a date in future that is a deadline after which the record should disappear from the webpage. The current option is "From Today to x Days in the Past (or Future)". It would be infinitely more helpful if it was "From x Days Before (or After) [date field]".

WEBFLOW-I-5784,An index field in CMS with the ability to easily reorder,2,Updating a custom order using a number field is painfully tedious.  Currently to set a custom order within a collection I've always set a number and then sort by that order smallest to largest. Though when i would like to change that order it is a tedious task of shifting everything. I've tried incrementing by 10's to allow for quick insertions (like adding a new item at 15) tho am not of fan of how disorganized this feels.  Have a system generated 'index' property similar to a 'date created' that would allow for custom ordering of collection items.

WEBFLOW-I-243,Integrate editorial workflows in the CMS,27,The editorial workflow (boiled down) essentially goes: 1. Someone drafts a post 2. An editor reviews it 2a. Editor makes changes and approves or sends it back to 1 3. The post is published (or scheduled) It would be awesome if Webflow incorporated these stages in a more productized manner. So when a piece is created an editor is notified. The editor then dives in where they can make edits or comments and either send it to publish or "reject" it—i.e. push it back to the creator. Presumably this would require the following additional features: 1. More roles and permissions (writers who can draft but not publish editors who can review and publish) 2. Post scheduling 3.

Webflow polices your website's content and will cancel your membership if you create any websites featuring Source: Webflow ToS Section 7 It's ridiculous that Webflow so closely polices user content. With these rules the best design tool I've ever used becomes nothing more than a basic site builder restricted to something like a restaurant homepage. Please Webflow.

Also allowing certain options to only appear depending on what option has been selected before. Obviously this would mean need for more than 3 product options as currently allowed and more then 50 variations in total.

Cant use it on client work still cause most of my clients are Ecommerce platforms. I would love to make their websites on Webflow instead of Wordpress/Shopify but I see theres no payment gateway compatible with our country Uruguay. Maybe PayPal but people here are not used to it and dont trust it. It would be great if you could expand payment gateways for Latin America. For example "Bamboo Payments" "MercadoPago" or "dLocal". Or maybe you could add some "custom payment gateway" to add the ones more suitable for different countries. Thats all I hope that one day I can use Webflow for my Ecommerce clients.

We could meet a lot of their requests and provide a better them with better sites if we could define a set of symbols (or something other entity that is a predefined chunk of HTML/CSS/interactions) as insertable into dynamic items per dynamic collection by CMS editor users.

WEBFLOW-I-3055,Add API for Listing Edit and Copy Pages including to other Sites,12,As a Developer I wish to automate between project template moves. The goal is to separate development and live system into two projects and when everything is tested run a script to migrate the templates for a final review before publishing on the live website. Right now the possible workflows: Copy-Paste Pages between projects:Requires manual work and clean-up furthermore does not work with additional data like SEO Custom Scripts. Use a single project but publish carefully:Limits the abilities of change essentially cannot do major changes without breaking the production when publishing a single content which may have been updated with new changes in mind. It would be really nice to have an API endpoint where the pages could be listed from existing sites and patched using the reference of an already exist page including the CMS Collection pages and the fields. I believe this would be a great fit to webflow as it would still control the source using the Designer but adds the capability to develop and migrate individual pages using completely separated environments.

WEBFLOW-I-2067,Enhanced Staging With Editing capabilities,16,It’d be such a huge change in my workflow if the Enhanced Staging plan includes just one editor seat. In my opinion is a bit of a friction point that can be avoid. It will make the relationship whit the client that much better it will probably not affect getting the host plan anyway and will much the excellent user experience that Webflow brand have overall. Not to mention that teaching your client way in advance in a relax environment and mindset how to use the editor how to “make the design your own” by customizing the text and content and how clean and easy it is… whit out the pressure of the website been live and needing content right away can be a huge change emotionally.,05/06/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2067
WEBFLOW-I-4316,If a manual redirect has been added ignore the first "remove trailing slash"-redirect and directly redirect according to the manual redirect.,8,"Webflow always redirects a url from a url with a trailing slash to one without"  The above redirect is applied even if a manual redirect exists. This creates an unnecessary redirect chain.  Let's say I have added a manual redirect from /foo -> /bar. A visit to /foo/ generates the follow chain  /foo/  ->301-> /foo ->301-> /bar  It is not a major SEO issue but it is an unnecessary one!  My suggestion is: If a manual redirect has been added then ignore the first "remove trailing slash"-redirect and directly redirect according to the manual redirect.,14/06/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4316

WEBFLOW-I-5935,Navigator - ability to toggle more or less info (such as showing the second class name instead of just the first),1,See before and after images for a quick explanation first. At least in my case I standardize my "sections" so that I can easily adjust margins and other "big" attributes for the whole page at the same time particularly useful when moving on to developing the breakpoints.  Right now I have no easy way to see which section is which in the navigator apart from counting in my mind or expanding each section enough to see its content enough so that I know which is which - but at that point the navigator view is often too expanded to allow for easy navigation.  So it would be nice to see more or less classes or ids - maybe a control such as show "X secondary classes" and an always visible checkbox (and maybe keyboard shortcut) to be able to quickly toggle this on and off only for the moment when you're trying to figure out which element is which.  Another idea that might make sense and help with this - tagging or coloring certain elements which is of course something that would only be visible inside the Webflow UI.   ,25/03/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5935

I've been working with someone with a small laptop and she has shared her screen with me to show how wrong my assumptions are about how the site looks on that size of screen. I currently like to work in full screen mode on my 27 inch monitor. I can take the browser out of full screen mode and shrink it way down to get an idea but then my menus and palletes also shrink making it hard to work. It'd be much easier if I could just drag the bottom the same way but keep everything in full screen mode. It would also just be faster to try different screen sizes. Another issue that this would help address is elements set in VH units. As it is I guess and then go test later but this would allow for much more fluid fine tuning of these elements.

WEBFLOW-I-1784,Allow Redirecting Paths on all Pages,16,In addition to the existing page slug allow additional paths which do a permanent redirect (301) to the main page URL. Here I'll refer to those secondary paths as Redirects since that's their function. Often a given page needs to be referable by several different slug/paths; KEY IMPLEMENTATION SUGGESTIONS The redirect slug is full-path.  e.g. /foo/bar/page.  This allows redirects to function regardless of how the site hierarchy changes. It also supports "shortcuts" for print & TV marketing e.g. /mowers  ->  /category/mowers Whenever a slug is changed on a Page Folder CMS collection or CMS item automatically create a redirect for the old slug to the new path. For Folders and CMS collections that are moved via a slug change this could be a wildcard redirect such as /oldslug/* -> /newslug/*  Or you can simply create the redirect one each of the child pages (for a folder) or existing CMS items (for a collection) Redirects show beneath the Slug and can be added edited or deleted at any time. If you attempt to create an new Page Folder CMS collection or CMS item whose path conflicts with an existing redirect path alert the user to confirm. Notify them that the redirect exists and will be deleted if they approve. This maximizes the flexibility of the site and minimizes 404's without impeding change and new content creation.

WEBFLOW-I-1337,PayDock integration (allows for tens of Payment Gateways instantly),18,I recently discovered PayDock when setting up a clients store on another eCommerce platform where they wanted a specific Payment Gateway ie. ZipMoney (Pay later service). PayDock is a single API that can provide through communication with multiple Payment Gateway's. Instead of integrating payment providers one by one (which will take years) I wish that you Webflow would prioritise PayDock allowing us to choose from a large library of payment gateways out of the box. https://paydock.com/features/api/,09/07/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1337

WEBFLOW-I-4640,Custom HTML in Rich Text fields via the API,6,Currently (2021-10-28) Custom HTML embedded in a Rich Text field (via the Designer) is lost when retrieved via the API.  (Same thing happens with CSV export.)  All we see is a plain <div></div> with no indication that it was ever a custom HTML segment.  I can understand filtering out ill-formed and/or unrecognized HTML on import as a safety feature.  But this is our own content added through Webflow's development environment.  We should be able to get it back out again just as it was put in.  Even if it takes a different API call to get/set the custom bits and to know where they belong it would be better than losing them entirely.,28/10/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4640

I am aware this use be easy to do with custom attributes in the settings panel but was eventually disabled a while back.

We get a lot of really low end clients...they are just starting out but want an awesome website with no cms. Also cash flow is a problem so monthly is their only option. I can't justify to them that webflows $15usd is the cheapest option when they can get cheap hosting from hosting companies like godaddy ionos etc.  I want my clients to have the fastest site and webflow is that way forward but maybe we could consider an even lower tier.

Make it a list you can check/uncheck for example: change max-width of the overall design to 1920px. But also things to be aware of like: 'I created a global CSS class (in Custom Code) called 'mt-80' (margin-top: 80px;) that you can apply to all sections directly positioned under the overall header.

WEBFLOW-I-639,Webflow Hybrid App,21,Webflow needs to pick up where Macaw Scarlet left off. A hybrid approach to the Webflow app would be huge. While hosting is important it is becoming almost trivial to put a static site on S3 or other clouds. Rapid visual development is Webflow's value proposition. I would like to see the Webflow CMS broken off as a headless API service and the Webflow designer developed as a cross-platform hybrid app (static site generator). Embrace the serverless mantra. In a few years this may be the only sustainable model. I feel that if Webflow doesn't offer this kind of workflow they are perpetually going to be in the position of users outgrowing the system. Allowing designers to build websites is great and all but for next-level adoption Webflow has to be able to be inserted into the toolchain. Basically Webflow Designer should be a product and Webflow CMS should be a service. Pay $200 for Designer and crank out all the static sites you want. Push the sites out to Webflow hosting or save them locally. And if you need more click a button in Designer and start paying monthly to use the CMS service. Look at Sketch App and Adobe for parallels (kinda). Sketch App is sucking users away from Adobe and their monthly fees. Incidentally Webflow Sketch plugin would be cool.,19/04/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-639

This would benefit both store owners and their customers when it doesn't make sense to purchase more than one of the same product (especially digital products). When someone clicks the "add to cart" button for a product with this condition the button for that product should either be disabled or replaced with a "view cart" button until the product is removed from the cart.,10/03/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5910

WEBFLOW-I-5667,Stronger visual indication of "non-base breakpoint" status,2,I realize that some of learning Webflow is a "this is just how we do things just get used to it through muscle memory" kind of thing and the issue of accidentally making CSS changes outside of the Base Breakpoint meaning for those changes to be global is one of those. But I feel like it's awfully easy to forget that you're not in the Base Breakpoint right now and that making it more visually clear that that's the case is feasible. I can't speak necessarily to what that would look like but I could envision tinting the current breakpoint tab red or yellow (i.e. "you're actively responsive editing!") and adding a line of the same color below that/across the Editor viewport. Having that strong visual indicator in people's peripheral vision would help avoid situations where you curse to yourself and re-create all the CSS work you just did (obviously I speak from experience here).,21/11/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5667

WEBFLOW-I-2406,CMS - Keyboard shortcuts & interaction improvements,12,Having the CMS is great but its input mechanism still feels like editing a MySQL-database. Therefore some ideas to make using the CMS and Editor easier and faster for us WF-enthousiasts. 1. Keyboard shortcuts to speed up changes and allow for faster data input Right now the CMS editor is mouse-based. Thus making changes ultimately ends up with a LOT of mouse movement and clicking the "SAVE" button. I'd opt-in to allow for more keyboard-based control of the CMS and the Editor to improve speed with options such as: 2. Batch Edit : Edit multiple CMS-items at once Editing multiple CMS-items in the Designer and Editor is a pain. It takes endless mouse action (and thus time) to do simple tasks such as assign a reference field and then save the change. [see point 1] Especially if you make changes to the settings of an existing CMS-collection changing 10+ items is horrendous. Currently we can "delete" "draft" and "archive" items.

WEBFLOW-I-5660,Allow pagination + sort by shuffle items,2,As of now it's not possible to have both pagination and sort by shuffle items. As soon as you enable pagination everything becomes fixed position items no longer get shuffled. This would be useful for huge listings where the intention is to show the user something new every time while also not overwhelming them with lots of items. My use-case was to use this in the sidebar of related articles.

WEBFLOW-I-5655,Text editing has been semi-broken forever causing data loss – Bug needs fixed,2,At least since I started using Webflow in 2018 editing a text field (simple text rich text static CMS doesn't matter) works maybe 90% of the time. The other 10% of the time it looks like it works but when you navigate away and then return (or just refresh the page) the text you entered has parts missing and/or is garbled. When this happens it's always caused by pasting text and/or adding formatting like hyperlinks italics etc. (though most of the time those operations work fine). It can happen even when pasting plain unformatted text sometimes even text from other Webflow fields. No other web service has a similar problem (e.g. MailChimp Wix etc.). This happens at least in Google Chrome on Mac. Not sure about other platforms. I have reported this bug many times (very thoroughly). Every time has been ignored or given the runaround to purgatory. I am still losing text to it on a regular basis four years and counting. I can't be the only one labouring under this bug. Seeing as it causes data loss it should have been a top priority to fix a long time ago. Please upvote this.,18/11/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5655

During this freeze no one is supposed to publish to the production site since the launch date is in the future. They are using the staging environment to view and test updates.  Issue: Co-worker accidentally publishes all of the updates to the production site versus the staging site showing site visitors content that is not supposed to be released until a future date.  Current solution: Use a backup from before the site freeze. However this method currently restores whatever was in the back-end at the time of backup to both sites (staging/production). This is not ideal for teams who work on new ideas/content/testing on the staging site.Suggested Solution: When a backup is executed restore the back-end staging-site and production-site to their exact unique status.,11/05/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4237

WEBFLOW-I-1928,CSS auto hyphenation support,14,Apparently auto hyphenation was introduced to CSS in 2011 (!) and these days it seems pretty well supported (although not completely). I'd like Webflow to consider adding support for this. It would make text-content-driven websites more professional and give designers/publishers the sort of typographical control that traditional print has always enjoyed. Here's an article about CSS hyphenation: http://clagnut.com/blog/2395/ Possible ideas: Toggle on/off globally for all text elements Individual toggles for text elements Perhaps default to ON for paragraph div list and other standard text elements but maybe not headlines? With a way to turn off of course; defaults should be reversible by the user Admin Note: Right now there's partial browser support for this CSS feature. We currently have text-wrapping control available in Webflow sites so it's unlikely that we'll build out auto-hyphenation. A workaround would be to add a custom code embed to your site on the canvas and add in the CSS within that custom code block. This will render the hyphenation styles in the Designer and on the published site.,24/03/2019,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1928

WEBFLOW-I-3821,Improve Designer Performance by Caching Pages for quick switching,8,I bouce between multiple pages frequently in Webflow's Designer especially when moving elements or verifying consistency.  Every time I open a page in Designer Webflow starts the entire loading process again. There's no cache as you move between pages in the Designer. Our own live website loads significantly faster than the Designer which feels very clunky and slow.  Feature Request: I assume it's because the pages are not being cached in Designer. That might not be the issue but I'd like the results of a cached page: instant or near-instant loading of Webflow Designer pages that I've already opened during this session.  I'd rather wait an extra 2 minutes during first load or 3x the RAM consumption than need to wait 3-7 seconds each and every time I want to change pages.  On my desktop system I can switch between very complex multi-layer images & 4K video projects much faster than Webflow Designer can switch pages; perhaps this is the limit of JavaScript?

Additional imports would just wipe away the DOM tree for that page and start over with the new DOM imported.This would allow a user to import custom HTML templates and speed up the visual creation of elements (batching element creation). In a sense this would be a way for the user to quickly create a starting point for a page from structured HTML that is transit.Now imagine if the user could also import CSS styles into the style manager that could affect the HTML elements imported into pages.

WEBFLOW-I-425,Custom HTML elements or more HTML elements,20,Being restricted to only Webflow's pre defined html elements is often limiting. I want to be able to add <address>some address</address> without using the embed as this adds an extra div to the page. We use Webflow for various purposes and one of them is creating the base html code to use in a web or mobile application such as Angular. Often this uses many custom elements which makes Webflow limiting for those needs. For example <mycustom-element> Lastly there are several html elements missing from Webflow that makes it a challenge to always write the most semantic markup.

WEBFLOW-I-1919,View HTML + CSS + JS Side by side in designer.,13,TLDR This is not to be confused with Export Code features/function. Problem:  - Current solution to View / Copy code within designer is to view Export Code. - Export code takes way too long (sometimes >1 minute!) to view or copy basic HTML CSS JS. - Export code does not allow fast loading same page code - Export code does not allow load in background to retrieve (I.e. I cant work on other designer tasks while Export code is loading)    Solution: Create dedicated view code component 1. Create a 'View Source Code' button on the far right of the bottom Parent Div > Div tag selectors section.2. Enabling this button opens up a 3 column panel row (horizontally) similar to the editor panel on the right (vertically) 3. The panel has 3 toggle switches (HTML CSS JS) that auto flexes the 3 columns. For example if only HTML is selected the View HTML takes up 100% width. If HTML and CSS are enabled then HTML/CSS will take up 50% each. etc. 4. Column 1 is view HTML 5. Column 2. is view CSS 6. Column 3 is view JS 7. Each column has easy find and copy functions. 8. Find function shows how many instances of matches found in code. 9. Copy function allows copying highlighted a block or entire contents. 10. If Div block i selected on navigator it auto highlights relevant HTML / CSS / JS 11.

With this feature it would unlock a whole new set of powerful possibilities with components. For example I could create a big component which is the website main template (includes a header body and footer). The body could have an empty div which is designated as the child-container. Then in my design I'd throw in an instance of the template component and then I could put whatever elements I want inside the component (inside the main body of the template).Basically this would mimic the functionality of react's children:<Template>  {any_children_elements_or_compoments}</Template>,25/02/2023,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5893

WEBFLOW-I-2123,Allow Basic/CMS plans to upgrade to AWS Cloudfront CDN,12,Hello! AWS' Cloudfront CDN has 44 PoPs in Asia alone while Fastly's CDN only has 11 (and three of those are in Singapore). Some of us have Asia-only audiences and paying 2.3x a month just to get servers closer to 99.99% of our users is quite hard to swallow (especially when our websites are not businesses/e-commerce). For example we are a 501(c)3 non-profit and we don't need any of the "Business" plan features--except for a CDN that exists in the same country as our users (Malaysia). Fastly never joined the MyIX (Malaysian Internet Exchange) while Cloudflare and AWS Cloudfront both did join and thus provide far faster & more reliable caching. We would gladly pay $26/month (CMS pricing + $10/month) for all the CMS plan restrictions + AWS Cloudfront hosting. This pill is harder to swallow since the only alternatives are impossible: Cloudflare's CDN does not work with Webflow & code export (via a Lite Account Plan) is $16 additional to the $16 on the CMS plan.Please Webflow do consider this. Our audience is stuck on Fastly's few non-ideal CDNs. We'd give up all caching in Europe/Africa/South America just to get our major content cached in Asian CDNs near our users.// For those who do not know your Webflow CDN hosts all your images videos JavaScript and CSS. On Basic/CMS plans Webflow chose the Fastly CDN (with 11 servers in Asia). On the Business plan and only the Business plan Webflow chose the Amazon Cloudfront CDN (with 44 servers in Asia).,02/07/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2123

Letters become with concave surfaces without the need to use third-party design applications. All that is required is the setting of the shadow inside the font.

WEBFLOW-I-4584,Allow copy-paste of select field choices in forms,5,Currently choice values for select fields in forms must be added one-by-one. This takes too much time and effort when dealing with multiple fields with 100+ choices. It would simplify things if it were possible to copy and paste in a return-separated or comma-separated list of the choices and automatically populate the text and value of each choice accordingly.

WEBFLOW-I-2886,CMS Dream of every Webflow user.,9,Hei First of all nice to have this platform Webflow is really standing out from others in the market. I got super excited looking at all the cool features at first. But now I can see there are some serious limitations in CMS if I go for a long term plan here. Design tools are rich I admit. But the CMS dashboard is so limited for big ecommerce or course websites. I listed below the things are missing from CMS. Other platforms like shopify wordpress wins over these features. In fact I never seen a CMS without these features I can tell anyone using webflow for long term purpose feeling it. Collection dashboard feature request Duplicate multiple selected items Currently can duplicate one by one. Bulk edit option: Bulk edit selected items. example change linked collections thumbnails dates numbers field values etc. of multiple items at once. Sorting: Ability to sort via linked collections. Table Settings: Ability to select or deselect on what columns to show on collection table. Columns such as dates linked collections small thumbnails. Filter Option: Ability to filter via linked collection date published draft items. Unfiltered items should be hidden from the list. Collection Color Identifier: Add a color identifier option for collections. So when linked collection is visible with color on table items can be easily identified. Collection field prefix/suffix: Currently it asks for unique field name for different collections. Its possible to add current collection's unique  slug/id/name as field prefix to avoid conflict during field creation. That way we can use same field name throughout different collections. WordPress has it. why wont you :P Collection Media gallery/assets library: Have to upload images every time if clicked on collection image field. Please add upload image from assets option. Import and export update request Its asks for mapping to existing field in every import. I think its possible to detect if there is an same field name available and not ask for it. Maybe ask for 1. Make changes before import or 2. Import directly option at the beginning. Since this is the only import option we can create collection matching up with the csv headers or vise versa.  If you guys can make these features working this will be a dream come true for us.  Thank you,27/05/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2886
WEBFLOW-I-1730,Client/Project Management Options In Dashboard,13,I recently saw a demo for SiteJet another Webflow style online website builder. The ONLY thing they had that was cool was that on their dashboard it had the ability to choose what step of the project timeline the website was at and filter the dashboard based on those project milestones. You can also see stats based on those milestones and the revenue you're making from your projects.

WEBFLOW-I-4851,Background Video object-fit,4,The "background video" component has a hardcoded value object-fit: cover for the video element. This is a great default and is what most people probably want. Can we have the option to change this to contain or inherit? I can work around this with custom css on the page but I'm only able to see those changes when I publish a site. This is fairly annoying when making adjustments in the designer or it looks broken to a teammate/client so I'l need to leave notes about it.   ,10/02/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4851

WEBFLOW-I-2470,Ability to create and publish CMS driven PWA's with Webflow,10,Hey all! I love Webflow but Progressive Web Apps are undoubtedly the direction things are headed.  Tools like Glide are making it easier to publish PWA's but the lack of design control and functionality plus having to basically become a master of Sheets algorithms etc is just maddening.  Bubble and the like are just not for me either. Being able to create and publish PWA's directly from Webflow instead of exporting and patching together in other services seems like a no-brainer especially now that Webflow is flush with new Series-A cash!

WEBFLOW-I-4780,Webflow Should Be 100% Free with no files limit,4,Referring to the account plans... apart from limits on files the other benefits comes with site plans for individual sites. So as long as i can buy a plan for all my sites I can use WebFlow free right? The problem is buying a site plan on everysite some times some sites are still in the works or not yet ready to go live designers have inspiration for new project all the time the file limit has made a lot of people I know have multiple Webflow accounts. it does not make sense. I wonder how many people actually pay for the account plans but I would guess not many it does not make a difference if people are going to open a new account with a different email anyways just scrap it. give everyone the ability to create endlessly and without limits it would also be welcoming for new Webflow users and would reduce the confusion about plans. Webflow can still charge for teams and all. I just hate that I cannot hit "new project" when I want. sometimes it might even be a project I am trying to clone and learn from. you still limit pages within the site itself and that can stay. people learning Webflow on Webflow university have to create multiple projects and delete and create and delete just to finish a course building one website make that make sense.,27/01/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4780

WEBFLOW-I-4777,Replace anchor scrolling script by CSS's scroll-behavior,4,Handling anchor links in Javascript is not necessary anymore since scroll-behavior: smooth; allows smooth scrolling all over your site when clicking anchor links. Additionally the current Javascript implementation does not take into account CSS properties like scroll-margin-top or scroll-padding-top which can cause major issues with user experience when there are fixed or sticky elements on the page (ex.: a fixed header). Simply replacing the current Javascript implementation by a default setting of scroll-behavior: smooth; on the body element would fix these issues and remove unneeded Javascript.,26/01/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4777
WEBFLOW-I-2440,Forms on collection pages sent directly to a set email in the CMS item,10,I would like the ability to have multiple forms that will link to different emails specificly on collection pages.

WEBFLOW-I-2434,Choose which unused css classes to remove,10,It would be extremely convenient if I could clean up the css without being forced to erase all of the unused classes. I'm using Webflow and Udesly to maintain a Wordpress theme and I often need to replace designed elements with short-codes to extend the functionality of the element. Once the element is replaced its classes become unused and I can no-longer clean up the css without erasing them. Since I still need to use the css I've installed a WP plugin that stores code snippets and loads them onto the site. I'd rather not manage css in multiple places for a few reasons... You get the idea. Being able to choose which unused css classes get removed will let me store all the styles produced in Webflow in one place even if the element no-longer exists in Webflow.,11/12/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2434

WEBFLOW-I-4770,Stop duplicate classes of the same name,4,The Webflow builder should not allow you to make multiple classes with the same name. Some times I'm typing in a class and when I hit enter it creates a new one of the same name rather than just selecting the previews class I just made. It's incredibly messy when you're trying to go back and make adjustments to elements with the same name especially with a team of people. Because Webflow doesn't know which one you want to edit. As you can see in the photo I attached this is a small sample of all of the duplicate classes and combo classes that were created. Webflow shouldn't allow you to make 2 classes of the same name it's very inconsistent.,23/01/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4770

WEBFLOW-I-4766,Multi-select product variants with Checkboxes,4,Would love to see checkboxes for Variants.

Example use cases:  PRODUCT X - $100 ☑️ Add gift wrap $5 ☑️ 5 year warranty $50  Or service add-ons: SERVICE X - $1000 ☑️ 60-day Email Support $100 ☑️ Special Plugin $50 ☑️ Special Files $30  Similar idea suggested here: https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4744,21/01/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4766
WEBFLOW-I-4765,Give Design Collaborator Acces To Specific Site Only,4,In this day and age of online collaboration Webflow's collaboration setup is very expensive and often misjudged with the new digital collaboration works IMO.Noticed this in Wix websites I can give access to just the specific site for design collaboration. I am the owner of the site and it lives in my dashboard but the other Email holder gets an invite link to work on the website. They do not get access to any other site but that particular site only.

If I create a Home About Features etc. Sections and have them highlighted by different colors and have the sub-elements benefit from those colors...  I often get confused by which section I am in regardless of whether the other sections are collapsed or not.

WEBFLOW-I-1112,CMS collections & Symbols to be sorted alphabetically in the Designer,15,Currently the way CMS Collections and Symbols are sorted in the Designer (by creation date) makes managing and finding them VERY difficult.

WEBFLOW-I-659,Expanded Export Options,17,I am a programmer before a designer and would like to use Webflow to design front-ends for my Django backends. I can do this using the export function but not without a lot of moving and editing each time I export. For example all of the static files in my Django project are generally under '/static' rather than '/' (/static/js /static/css etc.). I have to export the project move the files into my directory structure and then manually edit all of my HTML to specify the new paths to the CSS and javascript files. I wrote a script to do this but it's quite limited in scope and difficult to work with. I realize that you guys probably can't try to optimize the export for all the various frameworks (Django Ruby on Rails etc.) but I thought a relatively easy idea would be to allow us some more simple export options - like the ability to specify a different path for the style-sheets javascripts and static images.Thanks for all your hard work!,26/04/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-659
WEBFLOW-I-4743,Hreflang tag fields in project settings,4,To create multilingual websites using hreflang tags to tell Google there are multiple versions of the site/page that are targeted to different languages/regions.  if you could add all the relevant tags under one place and choose where they are stored (pages <head> tag/sitemap) and that you can choose to which pages you'd like to implement it. (or something in this direction)  This could be done under the 'SEO' tab in the 'project settings' for example.  It's just an idea and it may sound vague but it would allow Webflow users to create multilingual websites relatively easy and could potentially be a good solution to offer some kind of multilingual functionality.  This in combination with another high end Hollywood minded Webflow tutorial would be an amazing feature in my eyes. 😊  ,11/01/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4743
WEBFLOW-I-5870,Show Online Project Collaborators on Dashboard,1,I want to see all the online collaborators on projects in the dashboard. Particularly which projects the collaborators are working in. I envision this would appear as an overlay when you hover over a project that shows their little round icons or will display "# of users currently working in this project" if the number of collaborators is large.

WEBFLOW-I-4167,Allow opting out of Google's FLoC,6,Google's new tracking technology called FLoC is a privacy nightmare. Luckily there is a way to opt out by setting a response header. A website can opt out by setting the Permission Policy HTTP response header. This can be done e.g. in the .htaccess file like so: Since Webflow doesn't give access to the .htaccess or comparable config files (understandably) it would be great to have a site setting where we can turn off or on FLoC. Of course the default should be off.Here's a good article if you want more infos on FLoC.,15/04/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4167

WEBFLOW-I-5476,Device Previews,2,Designing in Webflow is amazing on its own but I think we are missing the ability to look at how the design will actually look on a certain device.  Knowing that we can "just resize" the browser window it actually goes beyond that.  Having some mockups that we can choose from at certain widths that already adjust the height as well would be perfect to test it natively in the platform as opposed to use having to use extensions and publishing and reloading the site every time we want to make sure something worked. There is a great extension that does that: https://www.webmobilefirst.com/en/But I think Webflow can do better :) ,30/09/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5476

WEBFLOW-I-1044,Better Export Options and Minified Code,15,With Control + O you can currently only choose to minify the HTML on Export additionally: 1. The CSS code could be combined into one file and also minified ideally it would export both a style.css and style.min.css file. Same for the JS file in addition to the current minified file export the unminified file too but in the HTML link to the minified CSS and JS. 2. It would be great to have a toggle which allows Webflow to minify the Custom Code of all pages. This keeps it easy to edit the code unminified on Webflow and saves time after the export.3. The option to export without the .html extension after all pages would remove the hassle of renaming all files and changing the links within them. All in all this would just speed up many peoples Export workflow upvote if you agree and let me know what you think!,14/12/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1044

WEBFLOW-I-2291,Bring back the clock!,10,In its early form the Webflow platform once had a timer which albeit slightly off tracked how much time was spent working on sites.

WEBFLOW-I-4720,Bring accessibility to the editor for website creators.,4,As someone with a low vision I have the unique perspective of being able to design websites from a visual perspective as well as using a screen reader. As a result I work with both blind team members and clients to develop websites. As a whole I believe that the WebFlow editor can be made more accessible with some tweaks. I have noticed that most menus are not recognized by screen readers. However once expanded via the mouse most elements can be read and interacted with via screen reader. Additionally things like keyboard shortcuts and the ability to interact within the editor itself would be helpful. We make an effort to make websites accessible on the front end but I would like my clients and team to be able to update and maintain the site on their own as well.,28/12/2021,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4720

WEBFLOW-I-5864,Dark mode for the dashboard!,1,Simple but a nice touch: adding dark mode support into the Dashboard (webflow.com/dashboard) so it's not searingly bright when working in the dark especially on bright screens.

WEBFLOW-I-4101,Lightbox on static page using multi-image reference,6,Webflow does not allow the lightbox to reference a multi-image CMS field on a static page. This can only be done on a CMS template page. So the user is unable to click a lightbox link on the homepage for example and directly open a multi-image lightbox. Instead they have to make extra clicks and first go to the template page click an image then the multi-image lightbox opens.,26/03/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4101

WEBFLOW-I-5048,Mobile number field in checkout,3,Allow for country code selection and mobile number during checkout as a default field. This is important if you want the phone number to integrate into other apps such as Vonage to automate texts.

WEBFLOW-I-290,Convert HTML into Webflow elements,17,I've just come across the need to paste a lot of HTML text into a page.

WEBFLOW-I-272,Print Media Query,17,We need the ability to style a print media query for pages that users will print.

You know that Webflow knows which assets are being used and those used assets will return once you're done. You select them all and delete everything and then you remember: Meta images aren't tied to the Assets panel. Ugh.Right now selecting a Meta image on static pages could be better. Not only would being able to select a Meta image from the assets panel be better UX (t's already an established pattern!) but it would remove headaches involved with deleting items from the Assets tab.,14/07/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4376

I am eager for one feature. It is the Japanese localization of the UI in editor mode. Many of my customers are elderly. The person is not familiar with PCs but wants to create a website. I don't know how to use it if the editor mode is English when the blog posting function is added. Elderly people feel a big hurdle to English.  I am confident that if webflow becomes easier to use in Japanese it will be used by many people.  My company can also support the Japanese localization of webflow. I'm sorry for my poor English.

WEBFLOW-I-2149,Group / Separate Collection Fields,10,When dealing with large forms (like on a real-estate website) it would be great to group/separate fields. In my example the "listings" collection has over 30 fields.  When you present that form to the user it's just a wall of inputs and it's a little daunting.

WEBFLOW-I-1241,Change a class or classes with interaction 2.0 IX 2,13,This would allow any element to be styled like any other element through interactions. The value and potential is almost infinite so it is hard to describe. The most common instance for me would be setting hidden values to elements outside of the child/sibling class limitation. Some other useful scenarios from recent projects would include: Allowing for all other CSS changes not covered through the default provided set with interactions Resolving the inability to create scalable blog categorisation due to the inability in setting conditional visibility on multi references by allowing a CSS class against the parent of collections Not having to create multiple interactions for elements that need click to current and hover interactions requiring any CSS outside of form webkit. In other words custom form elements. Stacking scroll hover or click interaction on top of each other in an easy way. Ability for more experience Webflow users to create templates or repeatable patterns that beginners could purchase or use that includes interactions they would not have to manipulate or understand to utilise (this one is hard to explain but comes from giving a lot fo training to people starting out with Webflow) Other cool stuff...,04/05/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1241

WEBFLOW-I-1431,Calendar view that sorts events by date.,12,Hello there We have a series of events and right now we can only provide our users with a button that sorts from oldest to newest and such. Our design consists of a calendar view that is always at the top where if you click on a specific date only the events that are happening on that specific date show up. Or if the user clicks a range from the 12th-18th only the events happening inside that range shows up. Have been killing myself trying to solve this issue or find a workaround.

WEBFLOW-I-2740,Non standard Breakpoint Highlight and Copy to Standard Breakpoint,8,With the addition of the larger breakpoint I've recently made a mistake I've made a bit in the past but now it's a little bit trickier to avoid. Because the changes cascade from the default breakpoint it's easy to make changes in another breakpoint that you meant for the default breakpoint. In the past the smaller screen size was usually the red flag so I'd catch myself fairly quickly. Now with the large one not being the default it's not so easy. In fact I just built out a whole page without realizing that the default breakpoint had no formatting whatsoever... so now I have to jump back and forth between both sizes and copy all the settings from the larger breakpoint to the standard one. I'm proposing two simultaneous solutions to this problem. One is to outline the settings pallettes in tan when you are in standard and blue when you are in smaller or larger breakpoints similar to how the settings labels themselves are colored when they are overiding the standard settings. The second is to have a "Copy Settings to Standard Breakpoint" function. This would allow you to choose items or hierarchies and copy their settings to the default and turn off the override on that breakpoint. In my case I'd choose the body item run this function and now my standard breakpoint would be exactly the same as the large one I just built out and the large one would have no overrides anymore.,11/04/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2740

I would recommend email and phone numbers are added. Plus I don't think the placement of the security codes is very intuitive. I have tried to set up 2FA twice and somehow missed them.

These act purely as visual breaks or instructions for clients to better understand the flow of information input. There would be nothing for the client to adjust with these fields because it's just a label and a line.

So that when I amend header-symbol.html it is affected in both files.. This would be AMAZING & speed up implementation when passing it over to other developers than having to go through all files?...

WEBFLOW-I-2632,Enable generated CSS code backed by Bulma,8,The Bulma CSS framework does in my experience produce a lot more fluent and robust responsive behavior with much less code than Bootstrap. What is more important is that it allows a reasonable development cycle by hand after the design is exported.

WEBFLOW-I-255,Add special 'Canonical URL' field type for Blog Posts Collection for syndicated blog posts,15,Create a new special field type called Canonical URL for use in a Blogs Post Collection for syndicated blog posts (posts whose original/master copies are elsewhere). By setting a valid URL in this field this would make it possible to show where blog articles using a syndicated article so we can point back to the canonical original article on the author's blog using a canonical link (maintaining SEO). Filling in this field would automatically create this under the hood: A canonical link in HTML <head> section ONLY for syndicated blog posts. To do this a rel="canonical" link needs to be added into the head area of a blog posts template creating this: <link rel="canonical" href="www.someblog.com/someblogpost"> in the head section - note. it should not add anything if the href is blank (or an invalid URL/broken link).  Justification and why hand-coding is not the answer Attempting to hand code this in the Custom Code - Inside <head> tag section is very complicated and does not seem to work despite a large number of forum post suggestions as to how this might be achieved. This will be a requirement for anybody that has blog posts that include at least one syndicated post - not least as this is vital for SEO so syndication doesn't look like duplication and therefore you find your lovely webflow site is punished by search engine companies and not appearing in search results.,26/01/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-255

WEBFLOW-I-2482,CMS Option to make multi-reference dropdown only show items based on assigned Parent,8,I'd like control over which by-reference collection items are visible to my client in the drop down menu when creating a new collection item based on parent category selection.  Collections: -Collection "Category" multi-references Collection "Types" which by-references back to Category. Collection "Products" uses the collections above to classify an item.  Example: -Collection "Types" contains items "Hats Winter Hats Mittens Socks Winter Socks T-Shirts Jeans Scarfs Shorts Warm Leggings boots. -Collection "Category" contains Collection Items "Winter Clothing Summer Clothing Hiking". -Collection "Category" item "Winter Clothing" multi-references Collection "Types" items "Winter Hats Mittens Winter Socks Warm Leggings".  When my client goes to create a new collection item in collection "Products" in this case item "Softy Woven Thermal Socks" they must assign a Category and then a Type. Naturally the product Category they choose will be Winter Clothing and the Type will be Winter Sock. The problem is that after selecting the Collection item Winter Clothing to assign a category the next reference dropdown with Types will display ALL types not just the types referenced by the Collection Category item  "Winter clothing" so they will see options that if chosen means the product won't display on the correct or any collection page because no logic exists because Types are only assigned to one parent. For instance choosing Collection "Winter Clothing" and then "Hats" means the item exists no where except maybe on the "Winter Clothing collection page if i added a list to display "ALL" items with current category. I'd like a way to control the data displayed in a multi-reference drop down to be conditional upon it's parent reference so clients can't incorrectly categorize products which with 100+ Types it is very easy to do.

WEBFLOW-I-5232,Basic Plan: Add at least 1 guest editor,2,Being one of Weblow's USP's: editing content on the front-end (which is great!) I find it striking that with a Basic Plan I can't invite a guest editor to edit the site. There are a lot of websites that don't need a CMS (or Collections) just plain text-based pages are all what a client needs/wants. So I think that a Basic Plan should at least have the possibility to add 1 (one) guest editor to do small text-based changes to different pages. Most of the Webflow designers here are freelancers that choose Webflow because of it's no-code approach: build websites visually and fast and bring these sites online without the hassle of continuously updating plugins or core software to keep the websites up and running. This also means that a lot of these freelancers serve clients on a more tight budget. A hosting fee between $12 or $16 (per month) can make a big difference in that particular client's budget. And these clients want the basic ability to do small text-based edits without being dependent on the designer who initially build the website to do this and charge them on a weekly or monthly basis budget-wise. In short: Add at least 1 guest editor to a Basic Plan and make both the freelancer and the client happy.,11/08/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5232

What I've noticed is that at the moment the only way to toggle the visibility of an element is to set it to display:none. A much simpler solution in my opinion would be to be able to click an eye-icon right in the navigator (similar to Photoshop) to toggle the visibility in the designer. It's a time-consuming aspect if you have a ton of stacked layers and need to change text since right now it automatically jumps/selects to the top-level element (z-index).

Please consider a function of "Copy CSS (to clipboard)" on any class as mocked up on attached screen shot.  User story: As a web developer I would like to alter the look of any element on any site using Webflow (as a element modelling tool) so I can save time on process of exporting project locating single element in CSS file and copying the definition to current project.  Use: After clicking the element expander I am able to click on "Copy CSS" which copies style of selected element to clipboard in CSS formatting for example following string is copied to clipboard: .header { height: 80%; min-height: 0px; padding: 20px;} :hover styles transitions are also included in copied CSS.  Test case: 1.task: Create element with class uniquely named 1. expected: Element created and named correctly. 2.task: Add background color set paddings for the element. 2.expected: Background color and paddings are set. 3.task: Copy element to clipboard using cmd+C 3.expected: Element copied 4.task: Past element on design canvas using cmd+V. 4.expected: Element is inserted. 5.task: Copy CSS to clipboard 5.expected: Toast message 'Successfully copied CSS of an element to clipboard' is showed. Disappears after standard time or after user clicks 'Got it'. 6.task: Paste CSS to text editor and check the output 6.result: CSS is correctly formatted and contains name of the element background color setup and correct paddings. 7.task: Try pasting on design canvas using cmd+V. 7.result: Nothing happens as clipboard does not contain object anymore. 8.task: Consider inviting Jaroslav to Webflow office 8.result: Jaroslav successfully invited.

When memberships was added this was the perfect chance to move to Webflow but there doesn't appear to be any method to add users to the Webflow database via external authentication. If we had access to APIs to insert users and create and validate authorized sessions it would allow us to pivot off Wordpress and onto your platform. As it stands now though we can't make the move.

It feels like we are being asked to double-pay for the privilege of contributing to the marketplace.Furthermore it appears that Webflow's current plans do not take into account the needs of template makers in this context. I understand the need for hosting fees but I believe that there must be a way for Webflow to accommodate template makers who want to contribute to the marketplace without requiring additional payment for hosting.I would greatly appreciate it if the Webflow team could look into this matter and find a solution that is fair for both the company and freelance template makers.

WEBFLOW-I-4470,Replace combo and global classes with BEM Style Manager,4,The current Style Manager and the way Webflow handles global and combo classes can be a bit confusing and unintuitive. I'd like to propose a new way for handling classes which mirrors Block-Element-Modifier (BEM) conventions. Here's how it works: Each custom class is now entirely an abstraction. Classes only convey that they are a div or something else that's very basic. Using / or __ in the name has the effect of creating a folder. If you have two classes named "Block/{class}" or "Block__{class}" and "Block/{class}" then they'd both be under the same heading of 'Block'. (This is a bit like what happens in Sketch or the Bear Notes App) The modifiers to those classes determine the look and feel of their assigned parent classes. All modifiers are global and interchangable. More recent/specific modifiers override prior modifiers.  As for precedent: someone could already employ this strategy if they wanted to. I've used c-abc to denote abstract classes to divs and then applied global classes/combo classes on top of them to govern how they look and function. What I'm proposing would make combo/global classes more intuitive.,30/08/2021,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4470

WEBFLOW-I-4437,Private clonable links,4,At this moment there aren't any way to privately share clonables to other Webflow users without manually send them to their accounts alternatively sharing them on the showcase (which defeats the purpose of a "private" clone).I would like to see a way to share clones privately through a simple link which another user clicks on and clones the component or project. This would be great for building private sellable third party component libraries templates easily share clones with other team members etc. without having to spend the time of manually send over the clones to other members.,19/08/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4437
WEBFLOW-I-1985,Auto create redirects whenever a slug or a Collection URL is changed.,9,It seems that whenever you change the slug of a post or a Collection URL you should be able to at the very least check a box and automatically create a redirect from the previous to the new field value.,26/04/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1985
WEBFLOW-I-1270,Changing size and position of Background-Gradients,11,It would be perfect if I had the same options on the background-gradients as I have for an img-background. At the moment I have to add custom code to get nicely transitioning gradient hover effects.

WEBFLOW-I-718,Cancel Account Plan: Choose which projects are locked,13,Currently the Webflow plans don't allow for a lot of flexibility. When downgrading a plan all but two sites are locked. Which ones? The oldest ones. Why would anyone want to work on their oldest projects from maybe years ago? Is this your way of forcing users to keep the current plan or upgrade?,31/05/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-718
WEBFLOW-I-999,Improve Editor Access & Usability for Designers,12,I often switch between the Designer and the Editor in order to see how content appears and edit it in the finished view.  This is especially important with CMS content since the Designer does not allow editing it in-place as it appears to the end user. The Editor is well-designed and does this well. However currently there are significant limitations in how the editor can be accessed by Designers - which makes it difficult to use the Editor effectively. Here are the 3 top places that the Editor can be made much more powerful to Designers. MAINTAIN THE PAGE AND CMS-ITEM CONTEXT WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN DESIGNER & EDITOR MODES Switching between Editor & Designer modes currently forces you back to the Home page. If the system maintained the Page and CMS Item context it would be far more useful during the site development process. A hotkey to toggle modes would be fantastic and a button next to the "Toggle Preview" button. ALLOW DESIGNERS TO LOGIN TO THE EDITOR DIRECTLY After a site is published I frequently need to make small changes. I'll be looking at the finished site and want to adjust something or add a new event to the CMS. Currently I cannot just login to the Editor.  I have to go to the main webflow designer and navigate my way into the project back to the Editor from there and then find the correct page again on the website before I can make a simple change.  A 10 second change turns into several minutes of clicking around trying to get into edit mode on the right page. REMOVE THE CMS ITEM LIMITS FOR DESIGNERS ON PRE-HOSTED SITES Pre-hosting when I'm editing websites through the Designer I can create the CMS items I need.  In Editor mode I get CMS limits error which means a tonne of switching back-and-forth. I have to switch back to Designer mode CMS to create the new CMS item and then switch back to Editor mode and navigate to that item in order to flesh out the content visually.,17/11/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-999

WEBFLOW-I-1955,Make the "Href Prefix" setting apply to search result URLs,9,We are using a reverse proxy to show our webflow project blog.toneden.io at toneden.io/blog. In our Webflow settings we set the "Href Prefix" setting to "/blog" so that all of our internal links point to the correct URLs (for example https://www.toneden.io/blog/posts/three-ways-to-win-big-at-facebook-marketing instead of just https://www.toneden.io/posts/three-ways-to-win-big-at-facebook-marketing). This has worked for all internal links but it doesn't work for the search result URLs generated by the search feature. When we enter a search query the URL generated is https://www.toneden.io/search?query=<query> instead of https://www.toneden.io/blog/search?query=<query>. This results in a 404 and makes the search feature unusable.  Admin Note:Workaround provided by Michael Greenwald is to add in a custom script on the search page:<script> var forms = document.querySelectorAll('.search-results-form');  for (var i = 0; i < forms.length; i++) { if (forms[i].getAttribute('action')) { forms[i].setAttribute('action' '/learn/search') } } </script>,03/04/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1955
WEBFLOW-I-1213,Set required field in CMS collection only *if* an other field is filled,11,Scenario: Imagine a blog layout which has a featured blog at the top with a large hero image then other normal blog posts underneath that don't have any image at all (just text). In the CMS I add a Featured switch and a Featured Image. Now if the blog post is marked as Featured then the Featured Image is a required field (can't have the hero blog post show with no image) but if the blog post is a normal blog post then the featured image is not required. Having some type of ability to dynamically set required field would be very handy.,19/04/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1213

WEBFLOW-I-1199,Global swatch support when pasting a class between projects,11,Currently when copying and pasting classes that use Global Swatch colors between projects Webflow simply converts the Global Swatch color into a 'normal' color value when pasting the class. It could be nice to have Global Swatches pasted over as well. There could potentially be a similar 'conflict resolution' behavior as is used with classes and interactions:  If Webflow introduced the idea of updating/replacing existing name matches in the destination site (like discussed for classes here:  https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1195) then we could do something similar to Global Swatches too if the colors didn't match but names did:  choose between adding a new Global Swatch updating the existing one with a matching name or using the existing one as-is.,12/04/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1199

When fleshing out the initial pieces of a new project (navbars sections containers etc) it can be frustrating to have to reopen the panel each time instead of just quickly grabbing all the pieces you need.

WEBFLOW-I-3195,Sub elements of date/time field in Custom Code,6,We could do wonders in Custom Code with CSS Calc if we could access the individual elements as we can do everywhere else with this field. (To clarify the Date formatting is already available in the CMS binding settings for text elements just not in the embed bindings.)

WEBFLOW-I-4745,Additional styles in Designer for base breakpoint if iOS or Android is detected,3,Hi folks!  More and more I realize that the "Tablet" breakpoint in Webflow is not really used by the majority of tablets for example iPad pro 10.5 in landscape mode loads the base Desktop breakpoint.  So the same layout is shared by laptop and tablet devices and it is such a hassle to try to use custom code to fix this. It would be great to be able to tick a checkbox in Webflow's CSS designer (if iOS or Android) and then apply a different set of styles to the same class.

WEBFLOW-I-3166,Permanently password protect non-Production Environments,6,What: Requesting an option to keep a password on our staging & development environments without having to toggle passwords on and off when we publish.  Why: medium-to-enterprise clients will want to hide in-development assets from public eyes and search spiders. It's hard to scale a hacky solution across multiple designer users.  More background: We've added all our non-production environments to one project. An ideal state would be that webflow users publish to the select environments as normal but there's a separate control that automatically keeps a password on the designated development and staging environments.,30/07/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3166
WEBFLOW-I-5171,Number Formatting,2,We need an easy way to format data stored in number fields - currency percentage etc...  Example - how does a real estate website store the price of a property listing. They could store it in a text field formated as "$999999." The problem with this approach is that you can's sort by this field without custom Javascript because the text field will be sorted alphanumerically which means the price $5000000 will be displayed before $600000. You could store the price in a number field but there is no way to format the number as a currency (with a dollar sign and commas.) You need custom Javascript  Webflow needs to build in native number formatting. While I love Webflow there are so many aspects of it that are half-baked.,07/07/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5171

WEBFLOW-I-5164,Fix Shippo integration for international orders,2,Currently Webflow does not send the following information to Shippo: weight unit country of origin Shippo requires this information in order to generate shipping labels for international orders. The absence of it forces merchants to manually add it for each individual order which generates hours of extra work every single day. This effectively makes it untenable for merchants to accept international orders through Webflow.

WEBFLOW-I-2083,Prevent hotlinking (stealing) of webflow-hosted images (and other assets),8,I would really enjoy an option to prevent hotlinking of my (image) assets that are hosted with Webflow. I write and illustrate stories and it's very easy for people to just copy the content and paste it directly into a forum post. If there was hotlink protection (which is very easy to do with htaccess on regular hosting or through Cloudflare when content appears on my own domain) I could make it so that only authorised domains could display those images. It wouldn't stop people downloading the images and uploading them somewhere else but it would be an annoying little speedbump. IDEAS: * A tickbox in hosting that says "only serve assets to this domain (or add other authorised domains)* An attribute that could be added to an image that prevents it from being hotlinked* Images are mapped to my domain (not uploads.ssl.webflow.com/blahblah) so that I can prevent hotlinking through Cloudflare* Or last resort... the option to regenerate a hash or something on an image so that everyone hotlinking will suddenly get a broken image.

In particular I need to send the firebase auth id along side all the other informations of the ecomm_new_order webhook that's to link the order to the firebase authenticated user in a safe and solid way.

WEBFLOW-I-2408,Master Template,7,So guys lets get this one going the guys at Webflow think this is an awesome feature also after I suggested this and they asked me to put this out to the community here to see what you guys think. So my suggestion is to have a master template that is rich in all the features currently being exposed in the Webflow university. features such as the interactions on scroll affects etc. this way there will be a rich starting point whereby the designer can choose to keep or discard the features that after all make Webflow unique. You see a lot of the templates in Webflow while good on design offer limited amounts of the features that makes Webflow an outstanding platform. Wouldn't it be great to have a go to website template with an abundance of interactions that Webflow is capable of providing to be able to utilise without resorting to going through a learning curve. I have also suggested that some of the features on the Webflow site itself be in this master template such as their very nice drop down top navigation menu and the scroll affects on the designer page. As a designer I know I can create the design I want from almost any template if to use as a starting point. What would make the suggested template highly valuable for me and other designers I feel is that the interactions and usability once present and extensive initially would add so much to what I think most users of Webflow are striving for which is delivering a rich and engaging user experience leveraging all that is achievable through the Webflow platform. However at the moment I see this is not being utilised specifically in the template arena to it full potential.,26/11/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2408

WEBFLOW-I-1567,More flexible forms actual button elements,9,Right now Webflow enforces a lot of arbitrary things when it comes to creating forms – and using some HTML elements outside of forms. For instance many elements like labels and inputs can only be inserted inside form blocks which add their own HTML structure that's not visible from inside the designer. Webflow also attempts to autolink elements together by changing their IDs and values automatically which has caused me a ton of problems in the past as these get changed silently if you do even the simplest edit causing your javascript to stop functioning.  Most importantly there are no actual button tags which is baffling to me. I don't understand why it's not possible to add button elements instead having to rely on styled anchors or input tags which is a bad practice both for semantics and accessibility.  I wish the designer had a "I know what I'm doing" checkbox that allowed users to add the elements they choose inside or outside form blocks without automatic IDing.,09/11/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1567

This can be done in the pop-up that appears when you click blue breakpoint-specific style settings e.g. button options- In cases where you will be overwriting a style-setting at that specific breakpoint you could alert and request confirmation. WHY THIS WOULD HELP When styling an element at e.g. the "Tablet" breakpoint I might discover that style setting works better at the "Desktop" level or at the "Mobile - Landscape" level. Currently the only option is to delete all of the styling and then recreate it at the desired level - slow painful and error-prone.

WEBFLOW-I-1761,Copy and paste from the showcase,8,Copy and paste is fantastic! It would however save quite a bit of time if we were able to copy elements from the showcase without having to name clone and load the entire project first. It's a bit much for small elements. If we don't want the project cluttering up our workspaces e have to take a few extra steps just to delete it. It's not the end of the world (obviously) but it's enough to keep me from saving projects as I go along. As someone who regularly makes my projects cloneable I don't care if they clone one section or the entire projects. If it's easier I'd rather they be able to pop in clone a button and pop out.,22/01/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1761
WEBFLOW-I-5063,Separate publishing of CMS and Code,2,There are often instances where I'm in the middle of working on site code but I need to push new content out to the site but I cannot because the code changes aren't ready.  Please allow us to publish side code independent of the CMS. Every site I've ever worked on in 25+ years has had a separation of code and CMS publishing so this feels like a weird limitation to have to deal with.

WEBFLOW-I-2171,Manually assign "for" attribute for Form Labels,7,Today in Webflow the "for" attribute for form labels is done automatically.

WEBFLOW-I-5062,Collections should have a static page field,2,When constructing a collection's fields "Page" should be a field option. This would let you choose from any of the static pages in your entire site's Pages.  I would like to maintain a collection of resources that each have their own custom pages. I believe the best way to do this is to build a static page for each and a corresponding collection item that maps the two. This would allow for users to create elements like directories or a navs where the nav items are pulled in dynamically and instead of linking to the collection item I would be able to link to a static page that was stored in that collection item.  A temporary workaround is to create a Rich Text field with the text I would like to display and have that link to the page but this is very limited.,14/05/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5062
WEBFLOW-I-3287,Make 'save customers card details for later billing' default with Stripe,5,Some customers prefer to have their card charged later by the vendor as opposed to by having to pay a series of invoices. When a user currently clicks 'save card for future billing' vendors can charge them but this often isn't the case. Stripe allow for all cards to be saved but we need Webflow to flip that switch.

WEBFLOW-I-2574,Use single-use license in a cloned project for testing purposes,6,I recently realized that it is not possible to clone a project which uses a single-use license template. One has to buy a second license in order be allowed to clone the project. Since I design projects on a customer base I often have to teach my clients how to handle their project in webflow once I am done. So they need a cloned project to be able to test things before they do it on the live project. So in case they break something in the test project it simply does not affect the live project. Therefore it would be smart to be able to hide the test project in the web e.g. as a password protected area so that only the logged in user who wants to test can see what happens online. The essence is: - get the possibility to use a license for testing purposes (or create some kind of "extended license") - hide the test project so that only one project is visible online Thanks in advance!Admin Note:Currently it's possible to duplicate single-use license projects of Webflow sites for the same project without being charged again. However an additional license would be required to be purchased for new sites. It's unlikely that we'll build out a additional staging set for single-use license templates.,14/02/2020,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2574

WEBFLOW-I-4097,Add % as an option for grid gaps.,4,I love the grid feature in Webflow. It helps me create interesting custom grids that would be used in print but that are responsive in web! This works for most things EXCEPT for CMS products or collections that auto populate into columns. I'll give you an example. The first image I've attached is a grid that uses columns as gaps. This way it's a truly fluid grid.  If I use a CMS collection it automatically fills every column so this doesn't work. You can see this in the second image.  Webflow gaps don't allow fr so it's not truly fluid. See third image. Most options are static (empx etc.). If they add % we can at least do the math to fill in those gaps. Might not be a huge thing but I find it important to have a truly fluid responsive grid option for CMS collections.Thanks! ,25/03/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4097

WEBFLOW-I-2545,Better Lottie Support,6,While playing around with Lottie and developing a concept website I have run into a few issues that can be quite the struggle.1. Lottie doesn't play image sequences properly on Mac and iPhone using the SVG Renderer however does so wonderfully using Canvas. 2. The Canvas Render method doesn't allow for fullscreen scaling without becoming squished or stretched when rescaling the browser.If you are planning on creating a site utilizing fullscreen Lottie then it is either uncompatible with Mac and iPhone and all the while pretty heavy on the machine with SVG Renderer or you can make it compatible with all devices but scale horribly throughout using Canvas. It would be an amazing tool for creating beautiful fully animated websites and portfolios but as of yet is sort of lacking in this area.I would be absolutely washed away if this issue could be fixed somehow.Thank you!To experience the issue yourself here is a preview link to my site:https://preview.webflow.com/preview/resurrected?utm_medium=preview_link&utm_source=designer&utm_content=resurrected&preview=ea7dc64835f3e46df80fdc451e8c7b51&mode=preview,04/02/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2545
WEBFLOW-I-5708,Using the !important property or ordering CSS declarations,1,Folks I've seen how important the possibility of using the !important property in some properties in CSS is.  For those who create a template (like me) and assemble a kind of "framework" leave these classes already configured for use in development. Throughout coding other classes are created and end up overlapping the previous ones.  Another option is to be able to modify the order in which the classes are declared giving freedom to move above or below others so we can keep the "priority" ones at the end of the CSS.,01/12/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5708

WEBFLOW-I-4541,Global interactions for HTML Tags,3,It would be great if we could set interactions for HTML tags for even more control.  While we can set interactions globally with the use of classes often I find that H1 tags or images I don't stylize with a new class but rather within the tag itself so it's quicker to build sites. I find that this also keeps the website CSS cleaner with some basic HTML tag stylizations.  The issue is once the website is built and we decide that we want interactions and let's say want all H1 tags to be sliding in when in view I have to go back to each page and apply the interaction separately to the element or create a new class for the H1 and apply that class to all H1's.  I think it would be a massive time saver if we could set interactions for a whole HTML tag to prevent creating additional classes and unnecessarily reapplying them.,02/10/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4541

WEBFLOW-I-3085,Integration With ShapeWays,5,ShapeWays is a manufacturing service which already offers on-demand manufacturing of goods through Etsy and Shopify to store owners selling things such as custom jewelry desktop decorations various tools artistic pieces and more. After the integration with Printful I began looking into the viability of creating passing avenues for my future ecomm store and found out about ShapeWays. With my love of CAD designing and how incredibly competent Webflow has been I do think it'd be a viable second option to expand on those partnerships. With the merchandise & textiles of Printful paired with the on-demand manufacturing & fulfillment of ShapeWays Webflow could be made a more potential alternative for entrepreneurs interested in running a broader set of dropshipped merchandise to make extra income without hassle.,12/07/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3085

WEBFLOW-I-3903,Design Editor with Full Design Capabilities in the CMS,4,The CMS rich text editor currently doesn't have enough design capabilities to truly build the CMS pages I need.  It would be great if the CMS had an option to add a Content Editor section where we had full design capabilities just like we do on the static pages so we could add custom design content to CMS pages.  Right now the only way to accomplish custom design is to use the Rich Text editor & then use the Embed code and write custom HTML which is not ideal.  If Webflow truly wants to be 'no code' they shouldn't make you write HTML/CSS in the rich text editor to make custom design in the CMS.,04/02/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3903

WEBFLOW-I-1966,CMS API GUI,7,How wonderful would it be if we could input an API url into Webflow and use that JSON data the same way as we can the Webflow CMS data? This would open up so many magical possibilities in Webflow. Yes it would mean people could manage their content elsewhere undermining the Webflow CMS BUT this could be a feature of the CMS package so no loss there. I work with clients who have central API's for news events etc. Webflow is the perfect system for marketing sites but there is no nice way to pull this info (yes I can use vuejs but this gets messy with embeded elements zapier – several issues here).

WEBFLOW-I-1957,Include all Rich Text elements default Rich Text Block,7,The Request Currently when you drop in a Rich Text Block the default information reads "What's a Rich Text element?…" etc. including only an H2 H4's and paragraph text right off the bat. While it's helpful to explain what a Rich Text element is (to first time users) and it's extremely easy to change the text elements to an H1 H2 H3 block quote etc.… it would be one less step (but many redundant clicks) if all Rich Text elements were already included right off the bat. Why It's Useful Whenever I create a new project I create a Style Guide page and drop in a Rich Text block and set all the styles for the H's paragraphs block quotes inline links (I also include buttons lists colors etc. outside of the Rich Text block as well). And while it may be relatively simple to convert lines to H's it would be one less step to setting all the base styles quicker as well as displaying all the Rich Text block elements at once (just so you know you haven't left out a base style). Workarounds I realize there are workarounds to this… 1. Do it yourself 2. Copy and paste an already prepared Rich Text block from another project (and full style guide)… but it would just be handy to have it all there already. The Bigger Picture Obviously the essential goal of this request to support design consistency and if there was a much quicker way to create a standard style guide right from within Webflow by default (for all standard web elements – maybe options for web apps vs websites etc.)… that would be extremely handy. But perhaps in future plugins. =),04/04/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1957

Having to select and preview each is laborious and it takes ages to really learn what each is like. I know the custom easing control has a little preview but I generally pick a default for speed. I made this little tool for myself to see how the easing modes look for the common use cases I have (sliding panels rotating or fading things).

WEBFLOW-I-4953,The ability to drag and re-organize css styles in the style manager.,2,Depending on when classes are created determine their priority. For example: classes at the top of a CSS stylesheet can be overwritten by classes at the end of a CSS stylesheet.  The same is true in Webflow. When a class is created at the start of development it can be overwritten by classes later in development.  It'd be great to be able to drag and re-organize classes in the style manager. That way I can choose which classes have priority in the published stylesheet.  For example:Say I wanted to create a set of global margin classes that added and removed margin-bottom at particular breakpoints. If I create the margin-bottom classes before my text heading classes the margin I add to the text heading classes will override my margin-bottom classes.This becomes a problem because I have to delete each and every margin class I created to then re-build the class later in development.

WEBFLOW-I-3746,Internal site anchor links open text entry,4,Currently working on a hidden site within our main page. The hidden site consists of 6-10 pages (modules 1-10) with individual anchor tags set up on links that are visible on the left portion of the page. As an example each page has a section with ID tags for 'lesson' 'activities' and 'resources'. Rather than going in to each page and modifying the external link to include '#lesson' it would be a nice quality of life feature to be able to have a text box under the Page Link Settings dropdown to type in an ID tag. Given that each page section might not be able to communicate correctly since the Page Section feature only shows anchor ID tags available on the current page having an open text box to type in what the tag should be would save a lot much time.  As an example of how this works in my mind: If the site in question was webflow.com/testing/module1 the open text field would allow me to type in "lesson" and the link when clicked on would go to: webflow.com/testing/module1#lesson. Then when everything was finished I could update the Parent Folder from 'testing' to what it is meant to be and the internal anchor links would not break. This would also allow for duplicate pages to be made (with the same nomenclature/structure) and the only thing that would change is the 'testing' slug; but all internal section anchor points still intact since they are using the Page Link Settings feature.,22/12/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3746

WEBFLOW-I-2231,Visual Button and Page linking like Adobe XD,6,Hi So earlier i was thinking about Adobe XD and how it is used as a concept tool for designing websites and apps that work with clickable objects. Now it wouldn't be too hard for Adobe to turn those links into real working live code just like Webflow does when you place a container or a div box. Webflow already allows you to link any button or object to a page/url. But taking Adobe's take on the visual effects of this linking it would be good to integrate this into the Webflow platform. So when you are on the Editor you'd have your work space where you could see all your pages laid out just like XD with visual links from each button/object to each other page. Be able to click on one of the pages and for it to enlarge to your full work space size so you can then edit in depth to the page.

WEBFLOW-I-1281,Derived Fields in Collections,8,I think it would be useful to add support for derived fields in collections. I'm imagining it could work similarly to Excel where you can reference a cell or group of cells to use in a function.  The use case I want to use it for is calculating points for a sports league website. I would like to be able to use the formula `points = wins * 2 + ties` rather than having to calculate this manually. Also would like to do this for summing games played: `gamesPlayed = wins + losses + ties`.

WEBFLOW-I-4400,Option to Remove Timestamp from Exported Code,3,Currently when using code export the generated files include a timestamp  time you run the export. I use Webflow as a templating tool. I export the files into my project and use version control to work out which files changed and therefore which parts of my code I needs to be updated based on the new design. Because every file has an updated timestamp added within it every file is marked as 'updated' in source control. The option to remove the timestamp before exporting from webflow would make it very easy to see which files did actually have design updates.,28/07/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4400
WEBFLOW-I-386,Public map of Webflow's focus of development and growth,10,As Webflow is growing more and more people would ask for more and more features in all sorts of directions. Loss of focus is really dangerous as it can bog down the whole development process make the interface clumsy and distort market positioning.Therefore my suggestion is for Webflow to publish a diagram of its planned areas of focus - where features should be natively developed along with its areas of focus proximity - where features should be available via integration with third-party services and area out of focus - where Webflow should know not to get involved but only suggest third-party services at best. This would help both the Webflow team and the community better decide what should be developed and what not. As an illustration of my suggestion I am attaching a sample "focus map":,09/02/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-386

WEBFLOW-I-2218,Prerender localised (translated) pages for good SEO and quick-win translation support,6,A mature CMS needs i18n support. Webflow has indicated that this is complex to add. Perhaps (for now) the truth is in the middle where Webflow would offer a tighter integration with platforms such as Transifex Bablic LocalizeJS etc. We host our sites through Webflow and have each site available in 5 languages. We use Transifex Live to translate our pages and I then manually edit the sitemap.xml e.g. www.example.com?lang=nl for the Dutch version. However Google does not like to index dynamically rendered JS. A friendly person at Transifex suggested that I pre-render pages. However I cannot install this on Webflow.  So I've attached a mockup of how this could look on Webflow. Basically: I let Webflow know that I've done the work and have translated the site (in my case in Transifex). Webflow then crawls/pre-renders all pages for all translations I've done and adds them to sitemap.xml so that Google will index the pre-renderes version of my translated pages. Done.,27/08/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2218
WEBFLOW-I-346,Make the site transfer feature free for clients who will add Webflow hosting,10,Hi I'm positioned in a country not currently supported by Stripe Stripe Atlas could be a solution but they have declined my proposal to participate in the beta and there is no estimate when it will become public. While they are working on it maybe you could allow Webflow designers on any current and legacy plan excluding Free to transfer full site and CMS to a client who orders hosting on a Free plan? Like that all the billings will be processed between the third-party client and Webflow and it would be 100% legal.

WEBFLOW-I-891,Client Billing - Customized Billing Dates,9,I would like to be able to customize client billing dates. I tend to bill according to when a contract is signed for services and this of course rarely falls on the same day for each client. On the other hand the date I start a project (and thus billed for hosting/fees by webflow) may not be the same date I complete the project in the future (at that point I begin charging the client for these fees). Furthermore dates may need to be changed in the future if services change or at client request. Even better if I can force all the charges to come out on the same day for all my clients no matter when they become a client (this would make accounting so easy to manage) I would like the ability to do so. A great asset to the fluid control of client billing would allow me to set and reset billing dates at any time and this be unique per client.

When building the article you need to insert "Rich text" to populate the article body which doesn't allow you to design anything inside it.  However it's important to be able to add inline ad slots after x number of paragraphs or even add a newsletter form to bring more leads but currently either you add it above or below the article body content.

Now this becomes much less important when we use styles (in Word or Docs) but it's still handy and it would be in Webflow too.  For instance if one of my sections is becoming too big and I need to turn some H1 headings into H2 subheadings it would be nice to be able to turn one into an H2 then copy the formatting with the brush and with one click on the remainder of the headings turn them into H2. ,07/04/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2726

WEBFLOW-I-4377,Markdown/HTML Support in Forms,3,I am finding the forms limitations a bit frustrating as time goes on. It would be amazing if Webflow would support Markdown/HTML in <textarea> fields within forms. Keyword "support." I am not asking Webflow to supply a WYSIWYG editor because there are great plugins for that which are easy to implement. Unless they want to offer what is being used for the Rich Text Elements but again not as important as simply allowing form fields to accept Markdown or some formatted text. I wish we were able to offer a similar writing experience as any basic email client that has some basic formatted text. Being able to press enter and write a new paragraph instead of Webflow mashing it all together into 1 paragraph when the form is submitted. Simple text links or being able to Bold or Underline some text. Simple bullet ordered and unordered lists. How about being able to use Webflow forms to populate Rich Text fields in our CMS via Zapier? I think you pretty much get the idea. I have heard a lot of people wanting this and I searched for Markdown support in forms here and didn't see anything.

Now its only possible to upload custom self hosted fonts but whats lacking is that a lot of good type foundries offer a subscription model only which is implemented differently. They have a font library external hosted which can only be added via a CSS stylesheet. So that wont work in Webflow without custom code and if used with custom code it can maybe only be seen on the published site and not in the designer itself.

WEBFLOW-I-4900,Calculation and Conversion of numerical quantities in CMS,2,I have artwork on a website which has dimensions. It need to be shown in CM and inches a conversion done brilliantly by a computer but only tediously by a human data entry operative.  I've got two suggestions... either.... 1 - have a number field type that also can accept units. These could be anything ... Km Centigrade grammes seconds. Then allow the item to be displayed in another unit... by selecting a compatible one in the display field on the website. So I might have in my CMS [Number][mm] where I enter '124' On my website I place a number field associate it with this CMS item and select [inches] as the display format... so it shows as '4.88' or '4.9' if it's rounded to 1 decimal place. This is very simple for the user... allows products to show alternative metrics and is fairly easy to understand.  Personally I favour option two...  2 - A Calculated field inside the CMS. I like this because it's more flexible. I could work out a surface area by multiplying two linear dimensions together. Perhaps I could use another database to look up a value (like a VAT rate against a product type) by which to multiply the first value. The idea here is that the values can be stored in the record rather than calulated on the fly so is done during data entry not by the server or client.  What I want to avoid is a person having to convert loads of data into alternative units.  Thanks. Brian.  ,01/03/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4900

WEBFLOW-I-4344,Simply remove .HTML from exported projects,3,When exporting a webflow project code the export adds a .HTML to every URL throughout your site. After years of coming across this issue and using the laborious workarounds to fix this post-export it really boils down to Webflow just wanting to make things difficult because you're not using their hosting. The Co-Founder in a 2013 thread on this very topic says it's because exported sites don't work on local machines without file extensions. He says this is because some folk won't be savvy enough to set up a local server. This is good and all but I'd be willing to bet that 90% of people exporting code are just immediately uploading it to another host in some capacity - which I would argue is the less-savvy route - and they do not need the .html extension. If people are exporting the code to edit themselves on a local machine they're probably savvy enough to not only set up a local server but also to add file-extensions post-export to make it work. The funny thing is all of the solutions to this issue on the forums from people asking how to remove the .HTML from their exported code (lots of them) require you to be relatively technically savvy anyways. All in all I just think it's an incredibly arbitrary feature that has 6+ forums dating back to 2013 with people confused as to why this is a thing. You'd think they'd implement some toggle feature to choose if you need file extensions or not. Or to export individual files. Or something just obvious like this. But that's where we're at.

WEBFLOW-I-2108,Email notifications field for out of stock product variants,6,Currently I can add a custom email form in the "out of stock message" for single variant products for customers to subscribe to stock updates easily. When one SKU inside a multi-variant product is out of stock customers aren't able to select it and the "out of stock message" does not appear unless all variants are out of stock.

WEBFLOW-I-1132,Add features to the X-Ray mode to help spot elements with dynamic properties/content and elements bound to IX,8,Those infos don't necessary have to be shown at once. Like the Grid toggle that has more than 2 states the X-Ray toggle could cycle between X-Ray X-Ray CMS X-Ray IX. X-Ray CMS would use a purple overlay for elements with dynamic properties or content. A red overlay for Ecommerce items green for IX… X-Ray mode would also highlight elements in the Navigator tab. X-Ray IX would use: the lighnting icon for elements with an IX trigger attached a variant of that icon for elements targeted inside of an _element trigger_ IX another variant for elements targeted inside of a _Page Trigger_ IX another variant for elements used as triggers and targeted by a legacy IX  Spring 2020 edit: xray could help identify what a CMS element is what an ecommerce is and also symbols overriden symbols nested symbols color CMS fields and overriden fields etc… the more Webflow gains in complexity the more xray would be useful.Imaging selecting an elements that's an IX trigger and see all elements linked with this IX… Would be cool.,23/02/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1132

WEBFLOW-I-5585,Fix Pages reordering bug,1,While researching this issue I discovered that it has apparently existed since at least 2019. Despite the UI suggesting that you can drag pages and folders to change their order in the Pages panel it just does not work — it invariably reacts as though you were trying to move that element's actual location in the hierarchy.

WEBFLOW-I-2554,Hide in designer but show on production,5,Hey guys I think the title speaks for itself but if not let me explain! I am quite a motion-oriented designer I love making load-in effects page transitions you name it.

(The one that indicates how many elements has the same class) In doing this the box of every element with the same class turns pink.But a nice step-up would be to make the navigator's elements also get highlighted which is actually more easier to see than trying to find elements that have pink borders. This also helps with finding for hidden elements or if the website's design makes it harder for us to see the pink border frame.,14/06/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4315

There's also no option in billing area to press a button 'attempt again' - you have to literally update your credit card details - to the same one. All other SaaS tools automatically attempt again after 24 hrs or atleast have a better option to just try again.

For instance I use WF CMS to create 'buying intent' landing pages for SEO and they need loads of content references on the page.  I think the CMS would benefit from having a sectional UI so the user can see which section they are working on. After a while all of the boxes look the same.  By sectioning it out for example into landing page sections it would become much better for a content creator to understand and visualise the page and which section they are adding the content to.,19/10/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5573

I will often need to use more than one of those in the same spot but since there's no "swap symbol" function any customization that I've done to the overrides (in this case button text and link) have to be performed again even though all I'm trying to do is change the style of the button.

WEBFLOW-I-5536,Pediatric ophthalmology,1,Children's eye problems are referred to as pediatric ophthalmology. issues such as blurry vision blocked tear ducts cataracts and reading difficulties. Congenital eye defects are those that occur when the child is born with the defect. Many kids and newborns deal with a variety of eye issues. It is best if these issues are identified and treated right away. Pediatric ophthalmology is focused on treating pediatric eye conditions. Early detection of vision-related issues in children is aided by pediatric ophthalmology. If not addressed within six months of birth eye abnormalities may permanently impair a child's vision. The reason for this is that during the first six months of life the optic nerve is still developing and if the eye problems are not treated during this time it could result in irreversible damage. 1. Cataracts: - A pediatric cataract is a condition where a child's natural lens of the eye turns opaque. The child has blurry eyesight and requires rapid care possibly immediate surgery to restore good vision. 2. Glaucoma: - The birth eye defect that can harm the optic nerves is congenital glaucoma. The youngster experiences photophobia which makes it difficult for them to open in bright light. The best person to give you advice is your surgeon who can prescribe medications or do surgery.3. Amblyopia (lazy eye): - Amblyopia also known as lazy eye is a disorder in which one or both eyes have an impaired vision that does not get better with glasses.

WEBFLOW-I-5506,How to get Social Bookmarking sites for SEO,1,Social bookmarking websites allow users to save websites on their browser so they can access them from any computer. Often these sites are useful for SEO as well and you can use them to promote your website. These sites were originally created for the sole purpose of bookmarking but later became a useful tool for SEO purposes. One of the most popular social bookmarking sites is backlinks bro it has We have 1000 social bookmarking sites list. Its cloud-based platform makes it easy to manage your content and organize it for easy access. The platform also aggregates content from RSS feeds. New content is automatically synced so you can access your links on any device. Its ease of use makes it easy to manage your bookmarks and it allows you to share and find valuable information without any hassle. Another popular social bookmarking site is Tumblr. This micro-blogging site allows you to post content and multimedia to a short blog format a free bookmarking site that identifies and organizes sites to help build links to your website. Free social bookmarking sites are a natural way to build links. However the process can take time. If you want to get on the front page of a social bookmarking site you should post as much content as you can. Aside from this you can also opt for paid social bookmarking sites to boost your website's ranking. This way you can get more traffic to your website without spending a lot of time or money. Another benefit of social bookmarking is that your website's web links are distributed across many high-authority sites. This increases your website's search rankings and provides high-quality backlinks instantly. In addition the links from these sites increase your website's domain authority and page authority. Furthermore you can add unique tags titles and descriptions to increase your reachability. The best part of social bookmarking is that it is free and is one of the most cost-effective methods to generate high-quality backlinks. Another great benefit of social bookmarking is that it helps search engines understand your site better. When you add content to a social bookmarking site Google bots will find it and index it faster. This will improve your rankings for relevant keywords. It also builds backlinks which lead to your original website. The Internet is a vast ocean of information. Often it is difficult to navigate and keep track of all the resources. However social bookmarking allows you to customize your digital experience by sharing your favorite links with friends and family. This can help you keep track of important content and find new ideas. ,07/10/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5506
WEBFLOW-I-4216,Remembering unlinked target names in the interactions,3,It would be great if interactions could store names of targets after they were unlinked – it makes more sense to know what is unlinked.,01/05/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4216
WEBFLOW-I-1881,Hide Elements in the editor instead of deleting them,6,I hate having to delete an element instead of hiding or disabling it because then I have to go back and create a new one with the same settings.

WEBFLOW-I-898,Responsive variants for the main image in lightbox gallery,8,When creating a lightbox only the thumbnail images get the srcset attribute for the image (img) tag. This is useful for the thumbnails but a bit of an overkill as also an image with a width of 2000px gets added to the srcset list (not very common for a thumbnail). However for the main image (the image that opens in the gallery when clicking or tapping on a thumbnail) does not have a srcset attribut at all. This means: the user agent has ALWAYS to download the largest image (as it is the original image) of the entire set. It's okay for a desktop user agent but is a performance and bandwith overkill for a mobile user agent where you would expect to have the browser select the best image from the srcset list. Wish: please include the srcset for the big image in the lightbox as well. This should not be a big thing but will increase performance dramatically.

WEBFLOW-I-4202,Place Collection Items separate from the Collection Lists,3,Collection lists are great but with both the wrapper and list element lists can add significant layers to the DOM tree. This is especially amplified in use cases where designers want to show only one item.  My recommendation would be to add a new element called a 'Collection Item' which could be placed anywhere on the page but would only display one item at a time. Designers could still filter and sort the item within the collection but having it be outside a list could help page speed while making maintenance of collection embeds easier.,26/04/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4202
WEBFLOW-I-5492,Allow client to re-arrange CMS template items.,1,I get asked about this a lot – I know Tim Ricks has a workaround that uses an additional collection which hosts "sections" the user can select and populate but the ability for clients to re-order project content in a  basic sense would be so useful (on a per-project basis).  We work with a lot of architects etc. and it's really important to them to be able to define how their image lockups/videos order themselves on the page depending on the project – at the moment all we can do is give them loads of options and put conditional visibility on any items that aren't used. But it's not exact and it's messy in the CMS.,04/10/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5492

WEBFLOW-I-1796,Have different prices depending on category of customers (ie professional vs end users),6,Hi might be long term shot but Ideally it would be lovely to have different prices per product depending on type of customer.

WEBFLOW-I-5479,Add the text-overflow CSS property,1,Add an option to set the text-overflow CSS property in the Typography section.  For me this would be useful to add an ellipsis to the names of my CMS items. I would prefer them to be constrained to one line instead of wrapping but this is impossible right now without custom code.

That seems like when you pin a column title that should be the manual setting of that title and it should remain not reset everytime I come back to it.

WEBFLOW-I-1721,Allow optional suppression of collection "detail" pages,6,When for example collection items are use solely as reference fields for other collections e.g. blog categories there is no need for "detail" pages to be generated and we don't want those pages showing up in the automatically generated sitemap.xml files.,10/01/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1721
WEBFLOW-I-1720,hotkey to make elements clickable like in preview mode,6,If you could hold a key and click on elements in the editor window to use an element as if its in preview/live mode. This would make the editing process much quicker especially form elements like sliders tabbed content and navigations.

WEBFLOW-I-1181,Add an option to render all links as absolute (for better SEO),7,Whenever adding a Webflow internal link it's nice that the page is always connected no matter where you move it within the site without having to create 301 redirects manually.

WEBFLOW-I-4709,Reference _id and default_sku as fields in Designer,2,Currently it is impossible to include a collection item's _id _cid or default_sku (in the case of ecommerce products) from within Webflow's Designer view. It would be incredibly useful to access them without the help of third-party tooling since they are currently the most reliable (and only truly immutable) way to reference an item or product.

WEBFLOW-I-4036,Add comma separator to CSV files,3,Microsoft Excel in Europe has issues reading Webflow-exported CSV files it inserts all columns into a single column per row making it unreadable.

WEBFLOW-I-2905,Add Designer support for CSS user-select to disable text selection or enable one-click all-text selection,4,This CSS property is thoroughly explained here with working examples: This CSS property is incredibly versatile and even beginners will benefit on day one of using Webflow: Clicking some buttons in Webflow (i.e. p in a div used as a button) quickly will cause Webflow to highlight the text. This looks very amateurish on a professional website. See attached image (or click here). To prevent easy copy-pasting of text (say of sensitive or gated content) this CSS property is usually a strong enough line of defense. By enabling the user-select: all choice you can now single click to highlight an entire line. This is very useful for users selecting text to copy like addresses or phone numbers or URLs. ,02/06/2020,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2905
WEBFLOW-I-5425,Custom Email graphics for specific products,1,For an E-commerce site it would be useful to be able to send customized emails for specific product categories so the customer can receive a better more product oriented correspondence experience upon purchase.

WEBFLOW-I-4704,Cascade animations by hierarchy order,2,Many websites want to have animations to spice things up but "reveal on scroll" is too limiting when there is a row or grid of items. They all come up at once. It's often a nice touch to have the first one come up then the next then the next etc with a delay between each. A staggered animation series or cascade.You can do this with some javascript but it's a hassle. And as I've posted in another thread the current hacks don't really work inside grids (which is strange because the things you'd want to cascade like a grid of client logos to show whom you've worked with would often be laid out in a grid).Since Webflow offers easy interactions like "reveal on scroll" it shouldn't be too much harder to have them cascade with delay based on their order in the DOM or otherwise.I've seen many forum posts on this but search didn't show up a wishlist request.Hack and my comments:https://discourse.webflow.com/t/how-to-staggered-scroll-reveal-with-webflow/95452/12Which is patchy at best.

WEBFLOW-I-2903,Show variants in product list when editing products,4,When you have a store with many items the product list becomes an important database and the ability to sort in as many ways as possible becomes really important. However a problem arises when products are hidden in variants. If you sort by SKU and can't see the variant SKUs when scrolling the list you are now forced to open each product. This can be exacerbated by working in teams where one person may use variants in a way that another might not understand. I would envision this as an option to collapse or expand them in the list. Where sorting would order them differently than their parent that they would be a lighter grey and be labeled as a variant. If you open it obviously it would open the parent. This could be animated as a way to clarify what is going on. For example in the site I'm currently working on there is me the owner and a person she hired to do all the data entry. The SKUs are all different on many of the products the data entry person chose to use as variants. Sorting by SKU when problem solving essentially shows these variants as missing products even though they are there. There are logical ways for us to find them but me and the owner don't always know that something was a variant of something else.,01/06/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2903

WEBFLOW-I-2184,Accurate shipping information on Zap/CSV forms,5,I've been stuck trying to connect my Webflow store with a shipping service. Already tried Shippo and Shipstation both through Zapier and via CSV order uploads. The main issue with Zapier seems to be the way address information is formated (feeds as a long stream of information). You can get around this by adding a Formatter action (but it's somewhat complicated). Another issue is that the streamed data is missing addressee name (not always same as the customer) and importantly the product SKU and weight/dim specifications. Some shipping options require that information. The main issue with CSV is the inability to choose information fields. Some critical info (same as with Zapier above) is missing. This is a crucial step in ecommerce. I can manually copy/paste the information onto my shipping dashboard which I'd like to avoid. Urgent please!,14/08/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2184

WEBFLOW-I-5396,Get a preview/overview of where Symbols are used on the website,1,Just like you can see where different classes are used on different pages with the Style Manager's: "Elements affected on other pages". It would be neat to have the same functionality on Symbols. Explanation: Right now the Symbols overview only shows the amount of instances. That is not super helpful when you don't know where they are placed. It's very time consuming going over 100 static pages and 500+ CMS Collection pages to find these. The reason this is much needed is because you can't delete an active Symbol with x amount of instances. You have to find all the instances and delete them one at the time.. So when you want to clean all your Symbols it can take ages. Having an overview like the Style Manager you can see exactly which pages you would have to go to and delete the Symbol.

WEBFLOW-I-3952,WF UI - Better accessible navigation and scrollbars,3,The scrollbars in the Navigator and Style sidebars in Designer are a real pain to access! I don't know if it's just that way in Mac OS but it would definitely help a lot if the scrollbars in the WF UI were wider and always accessible. Also it would be a great deal easier if moving around on a page in Designer could be achieved via spacebar/click (similar to Sketch or AI).

I love that you implemented this feature but unfortunately the image compression just isn't tight enough some times the image has been scaled larger than my original upload (that must be a bug) but generally Photoshop can still get the file size a lot lower at the same apperance. I would love it if you could implement a site by site disable basis for fully disabling responsive images at least then we don't have to worry about clicking the disable button for every image we add to a page and know that upon export extra images we don't want will be exported with the code.

WEBFLOW-I-3908,Collection Rendering Logic,3,I don't want to be able to just show or hide elements from a collection. Hidden elements still exist in the DOM and are still indexed by Google. I want to be able to use logic to output or not output elements at all. Example 1: I have a resource section on my site and it has everything from blog posts to videos to downloadable resource. Bonus: some of this content is gated behind a form and some isn't. Gated content has a different layout than blog content which has a different layout than video content. Guess how many times I'm outputting the same content to the page and just showing or hiding it based on content type? Lots of duplicate content on that page now that I'd rather not have because a) bloat and b) search engine indexing. Example 2:I have an events collection and a page with tiles for all of my live events. You can click on an event to go to a detail (collection) page. A pandemic hits! Now I'm running virtual events and I want those tiles to link to an external page not on my site. (Yes I can link to that from the content on the collection page but that extra step really hurts conversions.) So I'm outputting each event as TWO tiles one with a redirect URL and one with the detail (collection) page URL and showing/hiding them based on whether the redirect URL is set. Conditional HTML logic would solve this too! "Use this link IF this is set otherwise use this other link."  ,06/02/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3908

This video is in Russian but you'll get the point easily watching what he is doing: https://youtu.be/lNoHMPups6E I consider this animation very attractive and incredibly useful in some cases. but fighting with it for two days I realized that it's impossible to implement it properly with the relevant abilities of Webflow. Due to every device has its own width and height and moreover you change properties of some blocks for a better view it's impossible to implement this animation with any measurement units. If we could change flex and grid properties in interactions only then we'll be able to execute such a thing appropriately for every device.  and please add the ability to change the background photo in interactions because now I need to do so much work with buttons and icons while we don't have such an ability.,05/02/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3905

However these are not triggered by the screen size but by user selection: We could have "breakpoints" for Light and Dark themes or even create our own custom themes. Changes to the CSS properties would only affects the active "breakpoint"/theme.

WEBFLOW-I-2688,Ability to Lock Items to Prevent Removal by "Clean Up" Feature in Style Manager,4,I love the "Clean Up" feature in the Style Manager panel but the way it works right now this is a frustrating all-or-nothing proposition. Many of my projects include elements that are initiated or defined in a script that are dependent on styles I have defined in Designer. Currently Designer treats those styles as if those elements don't exist at all and yet they are mission critical to the proper execution of the website at run-time. I propose that within the Style Manager panel UI the user should be able to LOCK (and later unlock) any seemingly unassigned styles from being removed by the "Clean Up" feature. As it works now I either proceed with the feature heaving to manually fix everything that breaks EACH TIME or worse yet stop using the "Clean Up" feature altogether which defeats the feature's purpose. Once an item is locked it should stay locked until the user expressly unlocks it. That way in most projects it can be a set it and forget it proposition and users can take full advantage of the otherwise great "Clean Up" feature.  Admin Note:It's unlikely that we'll build functionality to detect if a class is being used in custom code. Instead we recommend building elements with the specific class names in use without custom code somewhere in your site (many people build within a symbol and then remove the symbol from the page after updating the element styles).,27/03/2020,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2688
WEBFLOW-I-945,See and copy the html/css on a current page instead of exporting the entire code,7,I use Webflow almost exclusively for prototyping and producing the template html/css that I use for my web application. I find it really easy to build out a page in Webflow and then just export the code and copy the CSS into my web application. However it gets a little annoying having to constantly export my code base to get the updated CSS especially if i'm making style changes on the fly within my application. It would be great if there was a separate window that you could toggle between the actual designer portal to see all of the CSS in realtime. That way I can just copy over the changes from that window instead of having exporting it and opening up the file in my text editor.,17/10/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-945
WEBFLOW-I-5330,Fix Template Billing- Bill at Publish not at Site Create,1,Webflow bills for templates whenever a site is created from one. This also happens when you try to clone a Template-based site or even to restore a Template-based site from a backup. All of this makes backup/restore and working with client site variations impossible without buying multiple copies of the same template for the same project. This also means designers can't try out a template to see if it will work for their needs before committing to it. SOLUTION- Template billing should happen instead at the point a site is published. Designers freely create new sites from Templates Editing etc allowed freely No publishing or export until the template is paid Ideally Template licenses are tracked in the account and assigned at publishing so that I can unpublish Client site variation A and then publish variation B in its place while transferring the template license over.,02/09/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5330
WEBFLOW-I-2683,Webflow + Bubble Authorization/Integration,4,With the unlimited possibilities provided by using Webflow paired with Bubble it would be nice if we could authorize our staged site to work with our Bubble account so that we could build the app without having to dish out so much money. I understand there are programs others have built that solve the problem however I believe a more native way of authorizing the API could work. If there is not a way to do this I understand just thought it would be a great way to help someone prototype a no-code app without having to pay until they re ready to launch. Could really increase the user-base because Bubble has over 300000 users who could probably benefit greatly from having such a powerful web design/front-end tool like Webflow.,25/03/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2683

That is the budget for enterprise accounts. but the transition needs to happen slowly price-wise as it changes all the workflow and probably needs to run alongside the budget for some time. The code it produces is not that important for advanced use of the features but it is when you need to start investing in servers and security on a larger scale if the plan is to be a wordpress or something that can handle large companies as their primary system. That would be a long term goal to me tbh.I am proposing a Design System capability to use as a support of the current design workflow with a better handoff.

This functionality could be paired with another functionality that could be the possibility to create new "pages" from a template (like header and footer and rich text) from the editor side.  It would be the best customer experience being able so to create a new page with custom pre-built sections and not have to always rely on the the designer for small changes.

The same can be said for the 'Current' state for links; you can only manipulate this value by selecting a link which is directed to the current page.My suggestion is simple; make these states easily accessible from a class level in the states menu.

WEBFLOW-I-3796,Pre-configure and manage global styles separately,3,Hi all!  I believe Webflow and it's community would benefit greatly if designers and developers are able to build clearly defined design systems by enabling them to pre-configure and manage global class styles without touching a single object.  If we take a look at how someone would set up a global style sheet using TailwindCSS or a similar framework we would always seperate colors form typography form spacing etc.  If Webflow allows us to manage these global styles without touching objects styling components becomes as easy as writing some classes. And that would speed my work up tremendously because right now during my design phases I define and maintain my design system in Figma and Notion.  Hope you guys agree thanks for reading!

WEBFLOW-I-875,Exclusive Toggles,7,I have a “Featured post” toggle in my CMS for blog posts… When I toggle a new blog post as featured the previous featured post is still actively on. This forces me to go back to the previous featured blog post and change toggle it off.

WEBFLOW-I-4636,Much easier sign-up & hosting purchase process for our clients! Single link sign-up.,2,Howdy! I’m a small agency owner and I’m switching to Webflow for all my client websites. I’m a little confused on how to easily show my clients how to create their own Webflow account AND purchase the CMS Site hosting plan.  I don’t really want to go the Client Billing route because I want my clients to own their own site while washing my hands of it unless they need further edits.  Common practice all across the Internet is for a customer to select a hosting plan and then the account creation happens during the checkout process. Dead simple. Not so with Webflow unless I’m not understanding something :)  Webflow has buttons under each hosting plan but they all seem to trigger the account creation process and then redirect to the dashboard page with no further direction. It seems you have to create a project before assigning a hosting plan to it.  I clicked the New Project button in my own dashboard and it wants me to select a template before I can even give it a name. I selected the blank template and named it and then it loaded the Webflow editor. This is NOT what I want my client to see!!! —a very technical and confusing website builder tool! At this point my client will be thinking to himself “why am I the one doing this? Didn’t I hire this guy to build my site?”  Right now I am thinking of creating a sign-up guide that will be either a bunch of screenshots and arrows or a screen recording video. A bit ironic after selling my clients on the ease-of-use of Webflow.  What I would really like is to send them a single link to a hosting plan that included the account creation as part of the process. Once their account is created and their hosting plan is purchased they could just send me their login info. No need for sign-up guides or giving me their credit card over the phone.,26/10/2021,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4636
WEBFLOW-I-859,Developers View,7,Like the Webflow's Designer view you design in the interface and the code is generated. It would be more efficient if there is a Developer interface so you can manipulate and develop directly on the application in a more seamless manner.

WEBFLOW-I-5285,Better free tier,1,At the moment the free tier is not ideal. As a multi-business owner who sets up websites a few months in advance only having the ability to have 2 sites and 2 pages is a complete joke. My proposed solution is to allow more than 2 but disable publishing for the rest until I can move them to a site plan. As a developer I know this is not resource-heavy at all to store the additional unpublished sites. Take a look at Figma for how they do their free-tier.

WEBFLOW-I-1945,Variables w/ Interactions,5,I would like to be able to use variables in my interactions and animations. For example. I am writing a navigation system which hides and shows the screens to display them. Writing the scripts for this is a PITA because you don't know hat screen you are currently on so you have to have a different button set on each screen with it's own unique scripts assigned. Using variables you could do it with one. Combine this with a more powerful If/Else statement than is currently available and that's rocking! It would also be cool to store data such as the browsers history so that you could make your own forward/back buttons,28/03/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1945

WEBFLOW-I-2535,Media Query Reset,4,Add media query reset for each screen size.  Had a website I was working on and accidentally changed some CSS on a mobile query. There is the orange/blue color indicator but the thing is I had to spend time searching for the element that had the blue color. I would've saved quite a bit of time if there was a button to just reset the entire mobile media query back to inherent. Having coding experience I had an idea of where the style was set but had I been a non-coder I would've been extremely frustrated.  I also believe having a media query reset button will greatly benefit people who like to experiment. For example they could try out many different layouts/designs for mobile and if they don't like it could easily reset it back to desktop inherent. But with it is right now if you were to experiment you'd have to go through every element you changed and reset each individual style which is just a ton of wasted time.,30/01/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2535

The outlines appear in the browsers I've tried (Firefox Edge and Chrome) but they do not appear when I view the page in Vivaldi.

WEBFLOW-I-5259,Start and exit indicator lines for scroll animation,1,Hey there so far I really love what you can accomplish with the animation framework built in Webflow. Before starting with Webflow I was used to do a lot of the animation work with GSAP which delivered an extra script so you could check where the scroll animation starting point is and where it exits. Of course this is already part of the keyframe timeline but there is no visual representation in the frontend view next to it.

WEBFLOW-I-5253,Allow us to empty a CMS field via import,1,The new facility to update CMS items by import is very welcome but it doesn't go far enough.  You can replace the contents of a field. Or for multi-refs you can add extra items or delete from many down to one.   This is great. BUT if you want to empty a field you can't do this via import. I discovered this yesterday when blank cells in my import did not overwrite the existing field cell contents.   I ended up doing the job manually which was rather a waste of time.  (yes I know you can delete the item and reimport as new but that gives you a new item ID and perhaps has other consequences so I am wary of doing that).

WEBFLOW-I-2510,Third Party Sales,4,The idea is to allow a third person in the online sales process basically as the person who place the order for a customer. This feature would help brands to keeps their sales centralized in the same place with the same user experience without sacrificing the possibility to take orders directly on their website from people or brands that would never have done it otherwise because they require that third party to do so.This include resellers (for direct sales) sales reps or intermediates of every kind in-house staff while attending fairs or even to sell directly without using a wireless card reader (iZettle for instance). Basically in every situation when a customer wants to buy you product without being able to pay or able to get the product right away. This feature would require a way to identify the third party (account system) as well as an automated process to notify the final customer the order is placed and must be paid. I can imagine an automated "order placed" email with a link leading to the website checkout page (were the form will be already filled card excluded). That link could be some sort of integrated "payment link" from Stripe already used as the built-in payment manager into WebflowPlease fellow designers make this idea real by voting for it.

If you buy 1000 seats but only use 100 you still get charged for 1000. We don’t think that’s fair. And it’s also hard to predict how many seats you’ll need in advance. At Slack you only get billed for what you use. So you don’t pay for the users that aren’t using Slack. And if someone you’ve already paid for becomes inactive we’ll even add a prorated credit to your account for the unused time.

WEBFLOW-I-1206,Knockout text (transparency) over backgrounds,6,It would be great to be able to knockout text on coloured / image backgrounds - effectively making the text transparent but to reveal what's beneath the layer.

WEBFLOW-I-4531,Ability to embed Webflow pages (ToS Privacy Policy) in external apps (React iOS Andriod),2,Preferably we keep your users in your apps rather than sending them to an external web page to read things like our ToS and Privacy Policy. However content security policies prevent us from embedding the pages of even our own Webflow sites in our own apps. So if we don't want to send our users out of the app we have to store copies of these pages in our apps. These copies are tedious to maintain.  Use case: Because Webflow is easy to use for non-technical people legal and marketing teams should make their pages (ToS Privacy Policy) in Webflow. These pages should then be embedded in web and mobile apps by the tech team instead of being copied into the apps every time there is a change.e.g. When the legal team changes the terms of service in Webflow the web and mobile apps automatically get the update because that page is simply embedded in the app.  Benefits: No need to host in 2 places. No need to edit in 2 places. Webflow can be the single source of thruth for the ToS Privacy Policy and perhaps even the About page. Example where it is being done:Regular Youtube urls can't be embedded either but Youtube does offer separate embeddable urls. Webflow could offer similar embeddable urls or a custom iFrame that safeguards the security policy.,26/09/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4531

WEBFLOW-I-1150,Export Route/Component Tree (API Endpoints),6,It would be awesome to have an API that allowed us to get the component hierarchy and tree structure that's built from each design. This could be really cool for building new components in React. Ideally I just want to fetch for a site or specific route and get back the tree structure of that route. For example... If I sent a GET to https://api.webflow.com/v?/sites/:site_id/tree It would give me the full site tree as I named it. That way I could literally compile that tree to a react tree and add in attributes/custom data on the fly. It would be even more awesome if I could also get the respective styles for each element in the tree. So for example... ``` { "body": { "id": 2f24fk5hash "styles": { background: "blue" } "components": { "section": { styles: { background: "green" } } } } } ``` If I wanted to have a specific component I could fetch it uniquely. https://api.webflow.com/v?/sites/:site_id/tree/2f24fk5hash/tree For routes you could do... https://api.webflow.com/v?/sites/:site_id/routes/:route_id This could give you the site's routes if they weren't already on the site object. If you wanted to have the components on their own store (denormalized).. maybe https://api.webflow.com/v?/trees/:site_id/routes https://api.webflow.com/v?/trees/:site_id/routes/:route_id/tree https://api.webflow.com/v?/trees/:site_id/routes/:route_id/2f24fk5hash/tree,11/03/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1150

WEBFLOW-I-4491,Dynamic page override,2,Just like components have override capabilities it would be helpful to have an override option on dynamic pages. This goes a little further than field overrides like in components though. What's needed is the ability to add sections and elements without affecting the dynamic page template. My organization is large and we have many departments. Each department is a collection item and they all utilize their page. Each department also has certain content that doesn't fit the template or another collection that could be referenced. That said it seems like template overrides may be the strongest solution.,03/09/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4491
WEBFLOW-I-2371,Client Billing tax invoices,4,Hello Currently when client billing is used an invoice is generated. However this invoice is "from Webflow to the client" it includes the Webflow platform and CC processing fees. The problem is that I as a freelancer need to declare my income but the tax ministry only looks at the invoices I declare. Therefore they will see me charging the client for the full amount of profit + platform + cc fees although my bank statement only shows the profit they only look at the invoices. Therefore there are two possible solutions: 1) Two invoices The same as the current one from me to the client and one from Webflow to me (the freelancer) showing that I paid the platform and cc fees. That way I can declare those fees and get back the taxes. 2) The same way there's the itemized and combined invoice we could have a third invoice type that is from me to the client but it only has the profit and no platform or cc fees then I can declare that for taxes as it only shows the profits I made. I think the option 1. seems more legally valid as it properly shows that I get the full amount and then pay the platform fees myself but I'm not a lawyer/accountant.  ,12/11/2019,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2371

I find that the help text a lot of times is not enough. It helps but I feel a rich text element dedicated for this would be much more beneficial in a lot of use cases. I feel like this would make things easy for designers and developers. If you think about it Webflow is made for designers really and when designers deliver content it's common to give brand guidelines to help clients understand how to use it as best as possible so everything stays looking great and consistent.,01/12/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1645
WEBFLOW-I-311,Ability to export and then re-import archive of Webflow site,7,It would be nice to be able to export past webflow projects and then re-import them at a later time should you need it again.

WEBFLOW-I-1563,Client website settings,5,It would be neat if we cold create global client-editable "settings" sort of like how Collections work now. Where Collections are different groups of content settings would be a collection of FIELDS editable from a single page which can then be used throughout the entire site. An example might be a progress bar/thermometer that the client wants to update. There's no real solution to let the client do that without making very poor use of a  Collection. Being able to add a "number" field as a site setting would let the client update that value and the page could pull that value to fill the meter properly. Another example might be setting an on/off toggle up with a text field to enable/disable an alert at the top of the page. You only need one of these so while you could use a Collection for this as well it's waste and counterintuitive for the client.,09/11/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1563

WEBFLOW-I-4421,Scheduled Site Backups,2,It would be really helpful if you could manual set a time for a project i.e 23.59pm (or any time you want) every day that creates a backup of the project in your dashboard. We look after a few clients sites but they also have access to the Editor. As there is currently no manual save options in the Editor side (also would be super handy). But if we haven't gone into the project for a few days but the client has made many amends and then makes a mistake and asks for it to be restored as our backup is 3 days prior they will lose lots of work. This would be a great selling point saying we offer daily backups and could avert or minimise the damage of loss. Ideally though a save in the Editor before you/the client does anything in the Editor is key.,12/08/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4421
WEBFLOW-I-1515,Above the fold Button (for Faster loading),5,Hi A great addition would be to have an Above the Fold button (ATF) this is to increase load speed and 'first paint' timings. The AFT button would work by putting the elements CSS class inline in the HTML and prioritizes the content to load. This is a great way to increase speed by Optimizing CSS Delivery. Google Lighthouse (Audits) have suggested this for my sites several times and have tried to 'botch' this but couldn't find a way.  The button would be a simple checkbox in the element settings tab.

WEBFLOW-I-3267,Increase editing control of ecommerce confirmation emails,3,I am using ecommerce to manage online donations for a UN agency. Our products are donation levels. As such they don't have or need images associated with them.  For the most part the system has worked extremely well. I've been able to style the checkout and confirmation pages to a very refined degree but was disappointed when it came to the confirmation email template which offered no design access. I understand how tricky and not-fun it is to design HTML email templates having done this myself for clients -- you have to use tables custom fonts are harder etc etc. So it's not that I want to spend more time on that aspect.  My issue is that without an image for the product the email template defaults to a broken image placeholder. My only option for a workaround is to go back and upload transparent png's for all my donation levels. But even then the table cell for the default image doesn't go away and stays at a fixed size throwing off the layout.  If not full editing control of the email I would appreciate being able to clear out the broken placeholder image that makes it look like something is wrong with our system.,31/08/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3267

WEBFLOW-I-2204,Placeholders for custom code in the Designer,4,Using custom code is great but it's difficult to tell how something is going to look when rendered (if anything at all). It would be great if you could upload a placeholder image for custom code to show visually what it will look like in the published website. This would be helpful for teams working together who might not be aware there's custom code in certain places that renders a UI. I know that a difficulty with this would be responsiveness so that would be a problem to solve. Maybe allow multiple placeholders for different viewport sizes? This would be helpful for me and my team as we embed Web Components throughout our website. Ideally I'd like to be able to execute custom code in the designer but I know there would be a lot of security concerns with that which I'm assuming is the main reason the code is not executed. I can think of other reasons but I'm guessing that's the main one.

Ideally I would be able to have a coloured band running atop the page if their hex colour was set but no band at all if not.

WEBFLOW-I-4345,Emmet & Auto Complete for Custom Code + Javascript in Designer,2,There are quite a few users out there who use a lot of custom code within their Webflow sites and if Webflow implemented Emmet or an equivalent option would make writing code in the editors a lot faster. In VS Code CodePen and other apps for example we have the ability to use shorthand entries to help auto-complete lines of code to make writing it much faster. API's for this are already available it would just be nice for Webflow to offer it.  An example for those not so familiar with it. Writing just link then hitting "tab" would generate:<link rel="stylesheet" href=""> Once generated the cursor is in between the href quote marks ready for you to add the url. You can see how much faster this is.Along with this it would be great if Webflow's designer could execute Javascript.

WEBFLOW-I-5156,Multiple file and price variants for different digital purchase options,1,For example if you are selling software such as fonts customers may only want to purchase 2 different font styles/weights. Therefor this would need to deliver different files based on the software which the customer has chosen to purchase.  Light Sans Serif - $20 Regular Sans Serif - $20 Full family of 5 font styles - $80 etc... Each with individual files assigned to their options.  If this could be implemented with the current product options with different prices listed for each item then I think this could be really powerful for stores that sell itemised/customisable software.  I can see this not being explicit to fonts either this could provide a lot of potential to creators of digital goods or even a way of billing for services too.

WEBFLOW-I-2085,Disable interactions on desktop after a certain breakpoint,4,I know webflow allows for interactions to be active/inactive based on device-type. But it would be helpful to specify which interactions are active (or inactive) based on actual breakpoint values and ranges. Hear me out. From the webflow designer interface I can see how my interaction is animating on desktop views. However desktop sizes can extend indefinitely beyond sizes like 1200px. Say I don't want the interaction to be applied after a breakpoint value of 2500px. There is no way to do that. Webflow assumes that if we want the interaction to show up on desktop by selecting "Desktop" then that interaction would show on ALL Desktop sizes regardless of how wide the size can get. I'd like to put a stop on the interaction after a certain breakpoint- it would be good to allow for that. Thank you!,13/06/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2085

WEBFLOW-I-5141,Keyframe groups with stretchable percentage allocation,1,The interactions/keyframe/timeline would benefit hugely from an update. Problem: Adjusting the positions of literally hundreds of instructions is extremely time consuming.  Especially if all you wanted to do was add some extra time at the top that then has a cascading issue. This makes it super tricky to adjust timings of the feel of a website as it scrolls. Solution:Ability to group keyframes and set the amount of percentage that group takes up (by input or by dragging the top or bottom of a group container) would really help. Imagine the groups took up vertical space and could be clicked into to reveal their animations within their allocated space.Grouping could be an added right click option after selecting multiple keyframe instructions.Grouping would also present possible extending options such as having alternate groups for varying devices in the same list. This in not possible at present without having to allocate an entirely new list or adjusted duplicate.Hope that helps should this idea be reviewed. :)CheersHamishUI designer,17/06/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5141

WEBFLOW-I-2864,Add multiple elements from finder at once. Similar to CSS emmet.io plugin.,3,Right now you can add only one element from finder so if you want let's say add two paragraphs you have to open finder type "paragraph" and choose it from the list and then you have to repeat that action once again. It would be much faster if you could write something like "paragraph+paragraph" hit enter and the result would be two paragraphs. Much faster right? Now imagine typing something like -"section>container>column>heading+paragraph^column>heading+list>list_item*3" the result would be two columns - one with header and paragraph second with header and list with 3 items all wrapped in a container inside section.

WEBFLOW-I-2855,Tabs for the Designer's Style panel,3,Hey fellow designers! I feel like at least 5% of my time on Webflow is spent just to scroll through the Style panel... Whereas a little something could make navigating through it very easy. I think the good approach would be the Photoshop/Illustrator layout. There the different styles are just tabs on the same row that you can access very easily without having to scroll a single time. You can reorganize them as you wish and even put them on several rows so you don't have 10 style panels stacked on the same one. I'm not necesseraly asking for the whole reorganize thing but the tabs layout as a start would be awesome!Here's a link that shows what I meanIt would be a very great upgrade for this already powerful tool that is Webflow.Vote this up pleeease!Thanks for reading and have a good one lads!,17/05/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2855

There is already a order filter for showing last modified or date created so I wonder why you also don't show bellow the sites' name on dash board the hour and date? without it it's also confusing if I filter by time because I don't know at first if created date or last modified is displaying as the first on the top or is the last at the bottom.

CMD+K (quick add) type some stuff + ENTER (to add the element) CMD+ENTER (name the class)  It is nice but it is limited. The limitations really show when you are Combo Classing your way to website build nirvana.  Combo classes are really the best way to set up for triggers and animations but the laborious task of having to navigate through each (for example) Container with a combo class... Z (to open naviation panel) up/down/left/right arrows (to navigate to the correct element) CMD+ENTER (to get cursor into the class manager) stuck...  The only things you can do here (from the keyboard)... Rename the existing class Create a combo class Delete the existing class ...we need another thing!  When debugging a site's triggers and animations before publication there's a lot of information I need to reference in order to figure out what is breaking which animation. The only way to get that information (currently) is by clicking into the text "Inheriting 3 selectors" and clicking the level of inheritance I want to reference or change the property...  Lots of clicking. Lots of moving between different elements. Lots of moving between keyboard and mouse. One step closer to webflow nirvana looks like... Rename the existing class -> CMD+SHIFT+Enter Delete the existing class -> DELETE Create a combo class -> CMD+Enter Open inheritance dropdown  Once the inheritance dropdown is open up/down arrows to select ENTER to choose.

However when you edit the same content within the page layout there is no such alert. On the contrary the field on the page accepts whatever is input making the collaborator think that all is ok. The tiny 'Error' label in the editor bar is not sufficient! Firstly it is easily missed and secondly it doesn't explain anything.

When I realized that it wasn't possible to configure multiple replies to a form I tried to configure the reply to be applicable to both and set the "TO" field to the {{ email }} variable so the auto-reply would go to my client (the Admin) AND the sender.For some reason I can't add a variable reply-to in the TO or CC option for this mail-out rendering it impossible to notify the client by email that their email had been received and (where necessary) provide additional instructions for them to perform.  The only response I got back from Webflow would be to integrate Zapier into the workflow but this is another paid option my client doesn't have the budget for.  Multiple-Submission Reply options would be a great feature (or at the very least the ability to add an arbitrary email variable to the TO: field) and I don't think it would be terribly difficult to implement this change.

I have built CMS generated landing pages but I'm forced to direct each form submission to the same location or else use the default success state.

WEBFLOW-I-1765,Simple Modification to Editor Setting on Elements- Massive Benefit,4,Webflow Community - Essential Control Feature: Having the ability to control if an element can be edited by Collaborators is fantastic HOWEVER the requirement to set each one individually is extremely time consuming but essential if you want to maintain the site design. I understand the setting use to be off by default and is now on by default. I suggest a "simple" change to the setting as per attached image would be a vast improvement and allow better-controlled collaboration with content creators. By adding an additional Tick Box in Editor Settings to Include Child Elements that would apply the On/Off Collaborator Edit Status to all children of the current element it would vastly reduce the time/effort to control this feature and make sure collaborators did not stuff up the site.  The CMS is a great feature of Webflow and yes additional roles and approvals etc would be great CMS improvements but this feature is so important to save deveopment time and control ongoing site design/quality.,23/01/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1765

WEBFLOW-I-5070,Change the default transparency swatch,1,There are some conflicts between Webflow transparencies specifically in Safari browsers. As you can see right here: https://discourse.webflow.com/t/gradients-not-showing-properly-in-safari/34757 https://discourse.webflow.com/t/strange-gradient-display-in-safari/57708 Long story short Webflow’s default transparent swatch is a rgba(0 0 0 0) and Safari in understands this as faded shade of black.  So the suggested workaround is to change it to rgba(255 255 255 0). Maybe I am a hard newbie but it seems that Webflow’s default transparent swatch is not editable. So to prevent further bugs on a loooong project I would have to through each instance of that transparency (even within gradients) and change it - or create a douche-bag script to just to patch this. 😂 Fix the Safari-Webflow transparency issue (seems too expensive to do) Make the default transparent swatch editable.

WEBFLOW-I-4112,Allow iframe for custom domains,2,Webflow is a great tool for the no-code community - it allows us to create functionality without the pain of hiring engineers. The problem is that to build a solution that fits your business you usually end up with a combination of no-code services like Webflow + Airtable Zapier etc. This means that bits of Webflow need to be referenced in other services - usually using HTML iframe. This is currently not possible because of the free plan abuse (People iframing webflow.io into their custom domain). I discussed this on the Forums and with Support and the only way to get around this is to export the code and host it somewhere else - which is both defeating the purpose of using Webflow and also requires a Account Plan (Lite).  My proposal is to allow the ability to reference the Webflow site in an iframe for paid Site Plans so that we can leverage Webflow without the unnecessary hacks.,30/03/2021,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4112

Webflow comes so much closer to production code than all of the aforementioned tools except for this tiny feature. Exporting the whole zip file hunting for the tiny block of CSS from the single generate CSS file converting it to SASS and then pasting it back into the project is process that can only be described with several expletives.

If the client billing will really be discontinued I propose to give us the possibility to create the client for hosting simply by allowing us to pay the invoice with the name of client.  In this way even if we would pay the hosting from our account we will be able to declare it to the tax authorities as a reimbursement of expenses because the invoice has been paid by us and in the name of the customer.  I would prefer not to have to give up the current client billing but if I really have to I only ask you to evaluate this small function that would simplify the life just complicated by the removal of the client billing.,28/04/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-5021

At the moment most of the content is designed with Articulate (Storyline Rise) and Adobe (Captivate) products. Both companies are lacking in creating a modern tool for professional eLearning developers. Especially when it comes to responsibility and accessibility the tools are years behind.

WEBFLOW-I-4994,One click working prototype generator using Figma prototype,1,I could be wrong but to me Webflow is (at least as an end point) an HTML/CSS/JS code generator. Figma is an all in one design tool with a semi powerful flow/prototype simulator.  Why is it such a big deal to import a Figma prototype (complete with all flow interactions and component animations) and with a single click Webflow generate a working web or mobile (hopefully PWA or hybrid native at the users selection) app?  Fully understand that it won't have back end support for forms or local device sensors or even some touch displays where third party libraries are required. BUT to hand off something that is at least as good at the Figma prototype and maybe better because it could eliminate any frame or component redundancies is a pretty extreme head start.

It will snap to a few pixel widths specific to certain devices. But you cannot lock onto a width for a specific view mode However when you scroll from desktop views to tablet/phone views and return to desktop the canvas width has returned to the full width of the available screen space. So if you set the canvas width to a specific value you have to readjust the canvas width back. I recently started using an ultrawide 21:9 monitor and I find this frustrating because I want to view the canvas at 1920p wide like most desktop screens.

True HiDPI would allow for uploading @1x images @2x and @3x. It's been a year since the iPhone X came out which has a proper @3x screen (unlike the previous iPhone Plus models which had downsampling).

WEBFLOW-I-2358,Dynamic website content based upon search query or location,3,It would be nice to have dynamic features available as an example of what I mean.Let's say your website site has multiple service locations but your website says (Omaha Nebraska) if someone were to search from Lubick texas it would dynamically change to (Lubick texas) or if we take this a step further even. Let's say you have a foundation repair website and you offer multiple services and someone searches wet basement instead of foundation repair the home page text could dynamically change to.Serving wet basements in Lubick texas instead of Foundation Repair in Omaha Nebraska. This would require a token system such as {city} {state} {service} and would require proper schema letting google know what your doing so you don't get flagged for duplicate content.,08/11/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2358

WEBFLOW-I-2343,Calendar Billing (choose a billing date),3,Being able to choose a billing date for hosting would be a big bonus for clients. For example being able to have a site billed on the 1st of each month. If hosting was to start on say the 14th we would be billed for the remaining days in the month and then ongoing payments would come out on the 1st.,03/11/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2343
WEBFLOW-I-3850,Dynamic Variables,2,We have conditional visibility ability in the CMS however we do not have a way (to my knowledge) to dynamically change those variables. One example of why this would be paticularly useful is a proper loading screen. Currently (again according to my limited knowledge) we can create fantastic loading screens however it's either all or nothing. I have created a loading screen on my site but it loads everytime I click on 'home'. It would be nice to have something such as the following: var runLoadingScreen = true; (created at site start-load)then in my interactions tab  add an action: runLoadingScreen = false; after it has loaded.That way the user would be able to view the opening scene only when they come to the website and it would not matter what page they enter from.,18/01/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3850
WEBFLOW-I-3846,Allow us to animate all parameters,2,extend the interaction tab by allowing us to animate things like the angle of gradients font of text etc. basically allowing us to create keyframes on any parameter so we are not restricted to the default parameters (move scale lottie opacity etc).

WEBFLOW-I-4966,apply an HTML tag to an element,1,It's a very small request but I believe it should be easy to do and it would make HTML tags much easier to use. It would be great if I could apply a global HTML tag to an element so I don't always need to leave the class field empty and then click into that empty field to get to the HTML with the risk that someone on my time might accidental name it something and apply a class to it. Or even worse go search thru the hierarchy list to get to the HTML tag at the top. And keep in mind that a class can even be accidentally created by just editing an element's style without a name if that were to happen on my style guide that wouldn't be good. It's just one extra step that doesn't need to be there. I should be able to apply my HTML tags to elements on my style guide then when I want to edit them I only need to click once on the element and start editing just like I do if there was a class applied to it. And I'd also have peace of mind knowing it's one less thing that could get messed up when a team member messes with the style guide.,06/04/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4966
WEBFLOW-I-698,Show when an elements attributes have been edited for the different breakpoints,5,At present when an element is selected the style tab shows a blue dot on sections where an attribute has been set. It would be really helpful if the user could see if an element has been styled for all the different breakpoints when it's selected (desktop tablet mobile landscape mobile). Perhaps the blue dots could be placed on the different breakpoint buttons at the top middle. See attached image.,18/05/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-698

WEBFLOW-I-1367,Dimension Editor,4,CSS allows for media queries. This tool should follow suit by allowing for the edition of dimension based blocks. Pre-loaded code could still act as the default (loaded at the top of a sheet). It would be interesting to see an editor where the base width could if allotted and not by default determine the reset element height and width at different pre-chosen sizes with surrounding width ranges corresponding to the media query min-device-width and max-device-width specifications.,26/07/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1367

The only possible way to do this right now is to create a lot of dynamic lists that only show one item. However the result makes the webflow designer very very very very laggy.

WEBFLOW-I-4951,Drop Twitter Links into a Page or in Collections and have the tweet auto-expand,1,WordPress Coda and Notion all offer the ability to drop a Twitter link into their editors and have the link auto-expand.With Webflow one needs to grab code from Twitter and then paste as custom code. This adds time to workflows and one can't see the full results unless published.A partial work-around is to post a link into the location field when working with a Collection but the content is sometimes cut off if it is a long tweet.Would like to see Webflow offer support to embed tweets into pages and Collection items.https://www.loom.com/share/5bdf31708f924f53a734e57171af54b4https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/embedded-tweets/overviewhttps://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cms/overviewThank you.,29/03/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4951

WEBFLOW-I-579,Pricing for Universities,5,As a lecturer at a college I am looking to find a more easy to use platform to develop web applications for my students. Webflow is a fantastic platform to work on as it is simply in browser and easy to use for beginners without limiting what the more advanced users can do. I propose an idea similar to that of a student discount however it be for a whole class instead; for example have say I have a class of 30. An account for each of my 30 students and an administrative account that can manage all of the students accounts (such as reset their password view and edit their projects and manage groups they belong to (such as group 1 and group 2). As for the pricing I suggest you do it based off the amount of student accounts attached such as the more students the high the discount. And naturally only allow registrations from a .ac.uk / .edu email address. Hopefully this will still give the same benefits of being a paid members like being able to export the sites to look at the raw code and use your own sub domains.

Neither Nobull nor Whalesync is even close to building a business (all still beta and no propper support) with. Some essentials need to be delivered by Webflow.

Right now any custom SVG filters must be applied via Webflow's custom code embeds: SVG <svg><filter id="…"></filter></svg> and/or CSS <style></style>. If you're unsure of the true power of said expanded filter functionality I have created merely one example (of effectively unlimited variations) to showcase just this; also linked below...https://matthewpenkala.github.io/SVG-Filter-Comparison/ 🗗 Also I'd recommend checking out: https://svgfilters.client.io/ to get a better idea of what I'm talking about.,25/03/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4946

You would like to present to user of your tool list of forms presented on particular site and it's fields. The user then could decide what to do with data of particular form. Right now it's impossible to do that without bothering the user to enter those form definition information again in integrators tool.

WEBFLOW-I-4937,Simplify the Heading tool,1,It would be nice if there was a more straight forward way to deal with Headings. Currently they are a little confusing and hard to keep track of especially in a team setting. They kinda exists in their own demotion where a heading element can have a class applied to it which effects style but there are the options to switch to H1-H6 in the setting panel which will also effect the elements style so they counter act each other in many cases. As a small example I can have a heading set to "H1" in the settings panel which effects it's appearance. But I can also have a class attached to  that very same heading in the style panel called "H2" or "Heading 2". It's very confusing and as far as I can tell it's the only element that functions in this way. It would really help if the standard H1-H6 options were put in the style panel similar to how "List" elements work where you can change the bullet style from circles to numbers and so on. After all it only makes sense considering you even edit the HTML tags for all standard headings in the style panel as well.,20/03/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4937

Considering the killer community in Webflow of devs designers etc. it may be useful to release a UI/UX kit of the platform for something like Adobe XD Sketch Figma etc. I've seen some users release concepts for Webflow features - likely created from scratch. Not only would it empower us to satisfy our creative ADD and procrastinate on our own work to show what we think cool features in Webflow could look like (especially when submitting wishlist etc) but it could potentially give Webflow themselves more of a visual and aid in the development / design time when creating and implementing these features.

The only quick link on the top right publishing area always directs to the home page and then you have to make it all the way to the page you want to view.

If you have several tabs that need to be thicker to showcase a picture it would be nice if you could be able to do in-page linking to the tab content. Currently when new users come to site. They can click the tabs but never see the content adjust - therefore confusing them.

WEBFLOW-I-4919,A Conref an attribute that is used to reference an ID on content that can be reused.,1,So if we had a Rich Text Element inside a CMS but there were multiple CMS Collections... but they all reference a particular product word quite a bit. "Product A" down the road the product name is updated to "Product B" so we could do a quick update and it would update the product name ever where it is to "Product B" using a conref attribute.

WEBFLOW-I-1194,Easing editor in all areas and proper curves editor for multi-keyframe animations.,4,For people coming from a traditional animation background setting easing with words is very confusing. I love the easing editor but am confused as to why it isn't available everywhere you can set easing. I also think that a modified version of the easing editor would be great for animations that contain multiple keyframes. This is also a traditional 2D/3D animation workflow and would greatly help us envision what is happening as we move through multiple keyframes. This would simply be a wider version of the current editor with additional bezier handles being added for each additional keyframe on the timeline.,10/04/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1194
WEBFLOW-I-4912,Adding base templates and partials,1,Idea:I would love to be able to set base templates and layouts/partials.Here's why:When there are only 5-10 pages making a change to the overall layout of page (like adding a modal) is no big deal... but when your site grows to about 30 pages or more that's a major task.  Proposal: If there were a couple of dropdowns (maybe under the "Parent Folder" in page settings) where users could set a base template and then another dropdown for layout (just another level of page hierarchy maybe) I think this would give everyone a lot of freedom and ability to avoid having to create the same page layout manually from page to page.  Basically the "pages" we currently have would be the main sections of this future version of the page with layout & template wrappers around it.  For example the new version of the page would look like this:Page 1 --> dropdown 1 selected: base template "my-main-base-template" --> dropdown 2: layout 1 "my layout wrapper" (masthead 1) --> current static pages  Page 2 --> dropdown 1 selected: base template "my-main-base-template" --> dropdown 2: layout 2 "my layout wrapper" (masthead 2) --> current static pages Page 3 --> dropdown 1 selected: base template "my-2nd-base-template" (different nav) --> dropdown 2: layout 1 "my layout wrapper" (masthead 1) --> current static pages,06/03/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4912

I'd like to be able to change a detail like the "description field" without a full reset as it's proven to be a pain point with long term clients who have specific needs. At the moment this means I'm using their Webflow invoice adding profit for ongoing upkeep and minor upgrades then billing them separately outside of Webflow for more substantial work.

So we can customize an email and include template tags to merge the data in. For example:  --- Hi {{ client.first_name }} Thanks so much for working with us at {{ company.name }}!

Currently id have to create a new button with just the class of button to add a state change to the button.

WEBFLOW-I-1699,Dynamic Naming of Classes,3,DISCLAIMER 1: I'm not a coder. DISCLAIMER 2: I've searched the WF forum and wishlist for a duplicate query but possibly because of DISCLAIMER 1 I might have misunderstood this to be a duplicate query if applicable.  On to the goodies---> I am utilizing custom code from a WF staff member here and this works well if and only if it is the only code needed on the page. I however am using it for custom external Paypal/Stripe buttons for various subscription products and therefore I need the class name of each button DIV to dynamically change. Theoretically I would like the ability to set a class name in the appropriate CMS collection field and then in the designer be able to choose a class name based on this dynamic field...AND be able to set that collection field in custom code so that it always populates class names dynamically. There may be a more intuitive way to accomplish this or not even computer-ly possible but that's my idea to my level of understanding :),01/01/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1699

WEBFLOW-I-4717,Choose which of the provided breakpoints is my base,1,Rather then having the 992 as the fixed base point it would be great to enable to pick your own base breakpoint. Be it a larger one and then work your way down or start from mobile and work your way up. Now working from the 992 breakpoint and then making the adjustments for the bigger screens make no sense since the design files are per definition always made for a larger breakpoint. 992px is an outdated screen size especially for using it as a starting point.,26/12/2021,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4717
WEBFLOW-I-763,Ability to have readable JS or uglified JS when exporting code.,4,Recently Webflow has decided to uglify and concat their Javascript on export I would like an option to turn this off because my team uses some of the components from Webflow but needs some to be disabled because of overlap with our current code base. it is a lot harder to now find the smooth scroll section for example which has a conflict with one of our scripts because there are no comments and the code is harder to read.3 weeks ago the export would have a very nicely documented JS file and I would like the ability to turn it on and off between these 2 options.,26/06/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-763

WEBFLOW-I-1668,Auto-bind option for CMS CSV Import for fields of the same name,3,I pay attention to name my CSV columns the exact same as my destination fields. I would like to be able to chose an auto-bind option so that the importer will try to auto bind all the fields. It would then let you review it. When the importer can't find a match it will create a new field based on the format of the data in the CSV. The reason is that I'm dealing with large datasheets and during the dev process I will have to import them several tie. Like 30 collections with up to 55 fields in each.

WEBFLOW-I-747,Larger font and better readability in CMS editor,4,Text editing in the CMS is painful because of three factors combined: 1) small font; 2) black background; 3) lines that are very long. I'd recommend to follow guidelines for good readability. A white background would be desirable but if not possible at least a larger font and the possibility to resize the editor would help. Ideally I would not want to have more than 65 characters per line. Trying to resize the font using the browser native functionality (cmd + +) does not work since everything gets larger and some elements get cut off.

WEBFLOW-I-1571,Ability to Restore a Backup to a New Project,3,This is pretty straightfoward- this would sort out a lot of existing problems- 1. It gives the ability to restore just a part of a site ( restore to a new project then use cross-site copy & paste to pick the elements you want ) including assets like site-wide code etc. 2. It minimizes the unnecessary reset of the CollectionID's and ItemIDs and consequently the breakdown of all Zaps & integrations. 3. It gives the ability to compare two different versions of the site side-by-side in client meetings. However if the site is based on a purchased template then this other wishlist item needs to be considered as well; Allow the ability to clone paid-template projects without paying again for the template (until hosted).https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1531,11/11/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1571

WEBFLOW-I-2797,Showcase Team projects on Personal profiles (Contributor Showcasing),2,Anyone that belongs to a Team account.   Our Personal profiles have no mentions of any Team projects that we are showcasing.  Many Webflowers run a completely solo operation. But for many of us we perform most of our work for a team or agency. In fact some of my best work lives under a Team account - not my Personal account.  Currently a project under a Team account is only showcaseable on the Team profile with no connection to a Personal profile.   Without this becoming too complicated I think this is best way to solve the problem - but I would love to hear alternative ideas as well!  1 -- Assigning Contributors in the Dashboard On the Project Settings below the Showcase toggle add a section to assign Contributors [1-dashboard.jpg]. This would allow you to select any members of the Team and assign them as a Contributor for the project.  2 -- Displaying Contributors on the Project Showcase On the Project showcase page add a new section to display the Contributors [2-project-showcase.jpg]. This new section shows the Contributors that were assigned via step 1 and links to their Personal showcases.  3-- Display Team Projects on Personal Profiles On the Personal Profiles a new tab can be added for Team Projects which would display any sites that you are tagged on [3-personal-profile.jpg]. ,28/04/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2797

For ex. if I want to select Palatino I would love to open font list type "pal" and find it. Exactly as it happens in site settings for Google web fonts list.

WEBFLOW-I-4684,Autofill Style Tags,1,I thought of a stop-gap solution for messy style tags that could potentially turn into something really useful. Currently when a new element is styled without a tag the designer defaults the elements name to a generic element identifier and sequence number (div block 1 div block 2 etc.). What if it still did this BUT if the styling applied to the new element matches a preexisting style tag the designer prompts the user to apply the existing style class that matches? It could come with different opt in features (per instance by default only on certain element types) and could potentially help with the messy naming conventions that seem to plague alot of projects. It's a rudimentary idea but I think the premise is really useful.,21/11/2021,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4684

WEBFLOW-I-4587,Greater z-layer control when needed (for interweaving layers). i.e. ability to force past nested-section layering,1,Most useful for moving components (or different speed scrolling). And it's useful for more interesting interwoven (vertically) design elements. And interesting design and moving components are why people choose webflow over things like squarespace. The PROBLEM is really that it gets VERY difficult to have an image (in section A) under a layer at the top of the page (section A) but over a layer later down the page (section B) when the rest of the section B graphics are above the layer of the upper page A. In fact it's strictly impossible. The image must be placed in section B at a spot that works even if the image belongs organizationally in section A. This is why I have the image for a hero section in the third section of my page but translated like 1500 pixels up the page.  And more detailed desire is that I know in the code you have the ability to force later sections to not layer progressively. That is merely a tool you use to make life easier and to stop the code from accidentally breaking a page because images have to be layered in some way. And you needed a method to auto-organize it.  What I want is a way to tell the page to let me break the progressively layering. AND/OR a way to let me see and change the 'True' "z-layers" in the code background.  I also know that the change wouldn't be crazy hard (unless it's tied to a large array) though it definitely would involve creating some more complex page safety measures. Like... no two images can have the exact same "True" z-layer... or something of the like,13/10/2021,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4587
WEBFLOW-I-2537,Warning/Marker for item causing horizontal overflow...,2,I don't actually know what the proper term is but what I'm talking about is when you shrink the width to a certain point and the page starts sliding back and forth because some setting is too wide. Unless you are purposely building a site with horizontal scrolling this is always a frustrating thing to come across. Usually I have to dig through every single item and check all of the width settings and often each item's grid settings before I find the culprit. It would be cool to have a warning that surrounds the item in red or at least pops up a warning at the top with a link that takes you to the offending setting similar to how it now tells you if you don't have the box for country in a checkout page. You could also have a "I'm making a horizontally scrolling page" button that would turn it off for that page.,31/01/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2537
WEBFLOW-I-1266,Horizontal Scrolling Interaction 2.0,3,Currently the vertical scrolling animation interaction is amazing. But what's even more amazing is its option to work horizontally.

WEBFLOW-I-2517,New Element: Dynamic CMS Nested Nav that can be indexed in designer but static when published,2,So far the most jarring limitations of the CMS is not being able to nest collections for the purpose of creating dynamic navigation structures. I get the 20 collection limit for performance reasons which is why I think something like an indexable CMS link structure would be great which could even be a new element. It would show up as a symbol or something and pulls dynamic link destinations and names from specified CMS sources then you click "index" and it builds a static link structure for publish like a table of contents in any publishing software from the data points you target. That way dynamic lists for the purpose of navigation structures never count against page limit or cause server load and can easily be dynamically updated if you change a CMS page link or name by simply re-indexing.  Seems like a quicker way to get CMS dynamically integrated into Nav structures without the performance issues.,22/01/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2517

I can be frustrating for advanced users to jump to different sections of webflow to manage their advanced components. It would be nice to place CSS HTML & JS all inside of a single embed element using an advanced option.

WEBFLOW-I-4494,Escape automatic URL encoding in URL field of link items,1,This would give the ability to place dynamic code in the URL field for parsing when the page is loaded.  An example use case is when using CouchCMS the system gives the ability to insert the site's base URL by using <cms:show k_site_link />  The current behaviour is that Webflow will turn the above into: http://&lt;cms:show k_site_link /&gt;  Adding an automatic "http://" at the start and url encoding the custom html tag that CouchCMS would parse before displaying the page.  Having to go around your pages to convert all of these links manually every time you update the site is painful.  This could also be useful if you wanted to use custom php functions in your URL's to be parsed at execution time. A lot of sites that are exported are turned into PHP pages.,04/09/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4494
WEBFLOW-I-4493,Marked Completed Webflow Lessons across different courses,1,It would be awesome if when you watch a lesson in one Webflow university course the other courses using that lesson mark it as played as well so you don't get confused or spend time watching duplicate content. Also I'm more likely to take another course if I feel like I've already halfway finished it.  For example if you've done the entire Webflow 101 course you've completed several of the video lessons in CMS & Dynamic Content but it doesn't yet mark those as played. I would love if it did.  Bonus would be for the course time to automatically update in the header with the content from the summary section. For example:  CMS & Dynamic Content | 30 min (14 min left) or CMS & Dynamic Content | 30 min (43% completed) or CMS & Dynamic Content | 30 min (8 of 13 lessons completed)  Essentially I just want completed lessons to be recognized at the account level and not at the course level.,04/09/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4493

WEBFLOW-I-4469,Bulk add / remove Team Users (especially for Educators),1,I'm posting here per recommendation from Ania from Webflow Classroom in our support conversations.  As an educator I started using Webflow in 2020 and started teaching it in July 2021. I hope to continue to use the platform as it is an excellent introduction for students new to web design.  Every semester I would have to add/remove 30-50 students to my Educator team. At the start of the semester I need to add one by one (the email field doesn't even let me paste a comma-separated list!). Similarly I will also need to remove every student when the unit is complete from the team.  The idea: - Bulk add students by email (allowing a comma-separated or line-separated list for easy copy-pasting out of student lists) - Bulk remove students (In the Manage Team Select All Members Bulk Remove.  This would remove a lot of frictions for educators like myself and save me 30 minutes every semester.

It's part of a company strategy to be able to communicate efficiently with its customers via phone chat email and twitter.

Just one false click . . . I may simply be too new at the application to have discovered an available method but I’d like  the means to keep work focused on the level it needs to be at.

WEBFLOW-I-4394,Add Rich Text preview to CMS data view,1,When looking at CMS collections in the Designer we can add or remove columns from our view. This is helpful when checking progress. Fields using Rich Text don't apppear on that list. If all I'm looking for is whether or not blog posts have their content or not I'd be looking for anything with a blank rich text field and currently can't see that withoug clicking into an item or exporting the list.I work around this using a "needs copy" toggle. This leads to lots of human errors when we're talking about 100's of items and multiple editors.,25/07/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4394
WEBFLOW-I-888,Domain Search in the Dashboard,3,It would be awesome to search for domains directly in the dashboard.

WEBFLOW-I-2182,Next & Previous Section Scrolling - Vertical & Horizontal,2,There are often UX needs for a scroll to next or previous sections in designs that rely on great imagery content especially those with complex interactions that may be missed out of the viewport. It would also be great to be able to scroll horizontally and link this way not unlike the slider widget that already exists but currently it is not scrollable.,13/08/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2182

WEBFLOW-I-2170,Word count as automatic CMS field,2,It'd be nice to have word count as a CMS field autogenerated in the same way the created on/published on/updated on date is.

WEBFLOW-I-4370,Option to undock and autohide the right panel,1,This should be relatively easy to implement. It would be nice to have the option to undock and autohide the right panel when no element is selected just like you can with the left panel.  A lot of Webflow users like myself design in dual-window mode with a Sketch or Figma file open on the other half of the screen so we need as much of the Webflow canvas visible as possible.,12/07/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4370

WEBFLOW-I-4364,Interaction "Trigger on" based on "hover" @media queries,1,With the new accessibility push it'd be great to target devices based on hover capability. In essence touch devices should not be judged by their size.  The hover @media query (linked below) has 95.6% market coverage and lets the developer assign CSS attributes based on the device's capacity to hover. This is both an accessibility issue and an aesthetic issue.  On Desktop 2 in 1s in tablet mode components shouldn't trigger hover on touch. Similarly differently-abled users may use their smaller devices with a cursor which can hover.  This could be a "trigger on" option in the interactions panel (attached) and/or an option in the selector dropdown.

WEBFLOW-I-4363,Improvement to Webflow UI Navigator and Style Panels,1,I'm not sure if I'm the only one but I feel like the vertical slider-bars in the Navigator and Style panels are super narrow (at least on a Mac with a large screen) and hard to grab – it's annoying actually. In addition sometimes the element layers disappear to the left (and the drawer open/close arrows are out of reach. See attached screenshots. It would be super helpful if the Navigator and Style panel slider bars could be a bit wider and the arrows for opening parent elements in the Navigator were to the right.

WEBFLOW-I-4361,Filter By Anything,1,The Filter function in webflow is limited to only filtering by CMS fields without any ability to inject an attribute or "filter for only this user" type fields. I went through all of your guides forums memberstack's guides and jetbrains guides and it seems like doing this is only possible in situations where you pass a static field to filter OR adding massive amounts of complexity for something that would take half a line of code normally.My personal goal was to create one member dashboard smart enough to understand who is logged in (via memberstack) and simply pass that user information to the filter or some middleware (like airtable) so that you can pull up a basic filtered list to only contain relevant information based on that user's ID or email.The ultimate goal would be to be able to pass a parameter to a filter but being able to open that field up as much as possible would be amazing to be able to filter and sort in more intelligent ways.I feel like this added so much complexity to a step that is so simple that it made me consider moving my project off of Webflow.,07/07/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4361
WEBFLOW-I-4351,Filter Automatic backups in Backups List,1,It would be nice if in the Backups Dashboard we could click a toggle button that would allow us to hide or reveal all Automatic backup records.

WEBFLOW-I-4346,Search support for accented characters,1,While many languages contain a number of accented characters (á ü č...) web users mostly don't bother when typing a search query and use their plain non-accented counterparts (a u c...). Currently Webflow search does not take this in consideration and thus searching for 'mexico' when the real content is 'méxico' ends up finding nothing. Could the scope of the search functionality be extended to consider the 'plain version' of the string to come up to the common standard of web searching?

WEBFLOW-I-4343,Update Video Lessons,1,The video lessons (as shown on your site and on YouTube) need to be updated.  Many were made in 2017 and the Webflow interface was much different then.

WEBFLOW-I-2129,Generic Payments Api,2,I can see a number of Payment Gateway integration requests - I could ask for a connector for Divido Financial Services but I think it would be more beneficial to ask for one generic endpoint that all these payment gateways can hook into allowing you to enable or disable gateways as they become available. ,05/07/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2129
WEBFLOW-I-4339,Display image assets in a different layout,1,Right now it's very hard to recognize and work with assets given that they're displayed as small thumbnails.  How about creating a second view of assets.  Put each asset in a row of its own.  Starting on the left 1/3rd of each row would be taken up with a thumbnail image of the asset and the other 2/3rds by the filename of the asset. I know that currently we can hover over each asset to see the filename but having to search for a filename when you have a lot of assets by hovering over each one takes a lot of time.  It would be much easier and faster if we could simply see the file names themselves.  Thanks.  UPDATE: I made a mistake. This capability already exists. The switch is very tiny and is located at the bottom of the Assets panel.,29/06/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4339
WEBFLOW-I-779,Ability to get SSL certificates to create HTTPS subdomains on other servers,3,In advance sorry for my possible poor understanding of this issue and mistakes I could write I'm not quite mastering all technical aspects of SSL and HTTPS. — Say you develop and https Webflow hosted site. And you need to embed a service in it (a booking service from a 3rd party booking company for example) and this service is using cookies. Your custom domain is https://customdomain.com. The 3rd party service asks you SSL certificate to create a https://booking.customdomain.com that you will embed in an iFrame on the Webflow site. But you can't because Webflow can't at the moment deliver SSL certificates for such usage. So you decide that the booking server (which of course needs to be https unless it breaks the https of the Webflow site) will be https://bookig-customdomain.3rdpartyservice.com. But this solution bugs especially on Safari and Safari mobile because cookies can't travel well from one domain to another. The result is cookies alerts and the booking system not working. I found this that possibly explains that: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/408582/setting-cross-domain-cookies-in-safari So in this case I can't use iFrame embedding at all I have to route the booking traffic to the booking site solely and that's not ideally clean because the URL changes the navigation gets more complex analytics isn't so easy etc... — Thanks for listening feel free to reword or split this request.,04/07/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-779
WEBFLOW-I-731,Hosting prices based on usage,3,Here’s an idea that would make hosting prices fair for everyone. Every developer and designer knows it’s hard to charge the same monthly fees for websiteshaving 30 monthy visitors compared to one having 30 000 monthy visitors.And we also know that Webflow needs to make a profit on hosting to be able to make Webflow even greater. So my suggested solution is to have price tier based on usage. For example: Plan 1  500 mb storage  500mb bandwidth500 form responses3 CMS user$ xxx  Plan 2  1500 mb storage  1500mb bandwidth1500 form responses6 CMS user$ xxxx  Plan 3 3000 mb storage  3000mb bandwidth3000 form responses9 CMS user$ xxxx ect.,07/06/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-731

I'm terrified that I'll be poking around a website one day and accidentally make a change not notice it it gets autosaved and it then gets pushed out in a publish at a later date. It makes me paranoid about going into designer ("what if I bump something?") and publishing ("what if I bumped something ages ago and now I'm publishing it?")

WEBFLOW-I-4168,Order limit on e-commerce sites,1,Orders in a store would be limited to the total orders that can be placed on them. Once that order limit is reached checkout would be disabled.

WEBFLOW-I-1792,Enabling free goods selling,2,For now in order to sell one product it has to be 1€ not 0€. Many of our customers are starting with free of charge sample producst at 0€ or €0 for now. Can we had order placement at €0 for US guys or 0€ for the other side of the ocean? Thansk,01/02/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1792

WEBFLOW-I-1786,Live preview of styes from suggested class dropdown,2,When suggested styles are focused (inc hover) in the class field dropdown the style should be previewed in the canvas.

WEBFLOW-I-1744,Implement attach file in Rich text,2,It should be possible in a rich text to also attach files as a link. In my current website I used rich text with unordered lists.

WEBFLOW-I-4136,Improved login access for the Editor,1,Currently Webflow does not have a single login button for all users.  Typically it does not make any difference whether a user of an online platform has admin rights or is simply an average user (in the case of Webflow this lower permission level is an "editor".)  Mysteriously Webflow requires an editor to know off the top of their head or via a bookmark the URL to log in and edit the site. They can't click on the login from Webflow.com in order to enter credentials. If they try this they will be informed that they don't have an account. That needs to be fixed ASAP.,05/04/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4136
WEBFLOW-I-4135,Checkboxes on Forms inside a Project Page,1,Not sure why this isn't implemented yet but a checkbox function could be really awesome.

WEBFLOW-I-4121,Auto-archive date,1,My use cases for webflow are a government organization and a home owners assocation.

WEBFLOW-I-4109,Live update in e-commerce order panel,1,It would be great if the ecommerce order panel in the editor would live update when new orders come in - currently you need to press a button or reload the page to see new orders (auto refresh plugins for browsers don't work as you always have to log in again when the page refreshes). I have several clients who get lots of orders very fast and they don't want to manage their orders by email but within the browser in real time (i.e. food deliveries...).,29/03/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4109
WEBFLOW-I-1695,Multiple Navbar and Footer Layouts,2,I would suggest adding a few Navbar and Footer layouts options so that you can quickly browse through a few templates instead of just having one and having to manually style it from there. 👉 For example once you add a Navbar you can browse through 5-10 pre-made Navbars with different layouts. This would help speed up the workflow when starting new projects.,29/12/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1695
WEBFLOW-I-4086,Detect Time Zone based on entered address,1,It would be much more designer-friendly if I could enter a location in a search box or something of that nature and have webflow detect where the time zone is at that location. I often have clients in different time zones so I cannot use Detect My Time Zone and I have to do a bit of searching online to make sure I am selecting the correct zone.,22/03/2021,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4086

WEBFLOW-I-4054,Cross-page undo,1,Undo (ctrl/cmd+z) only works within a page not across pages. That is if I make a change and move to another change I can no longer undo that change. This is very nonintuitive since the whoe collection of pages is one project and those pages often have shared content (like symbols).

WEBFLOW-I-4028,Inform if Rich image is too large,1,Presently for photos larger than 5MB Webflow's CMS is quickly showing a red circle (which can easily be unnoticed) on the photo and then the photo disappears it has been confusing for some of my clients already. Sometimes additionally it places a blank grey square at the top of the page which user is surprised to find later. For sure I am informing them that photos should be at best below 300kb but there should be a clearer notification in case of an error or if one simply forgot about the size of the photo.

WEBFLOW-I-1335,Syncing custom code to the editor,2,Webflow has improved my workflow a lot. But it would improve it double as much if you could sync custom code with the editor and display it. A quick search on StackOverflow precented me with a great Javascript algorithm for reading CSS class values of a stylesheet 1. You are maybe more focused on designers and no-coders. But I can tell you that to me as a coder Webflow is a great place to start with the front-end. But it would be a must-have tool only if it could properly read CSS values of a stylesheet in to the editor. If you are afraid of intimidating beginners make it a feature that can be activated under Settings. Add a button for syncing a CSS class with the editor and make a checkbox to show values that are not currently available in the editor.

Some of these items can only be dated by year where others can be dated by month and year. None of them can be dated by day.  The Date/Time picker requires the selection of a day month and year which ruins the taxonomy of my collection since it would require me to insert erroniously spesific dates. I'd like to introduce a feature to my site that allows users to browes the collection by date in an intuitive way but I cannot currently do this without irritating work-arounds.

It is a bit of a pain to happily work away in the designer on the presumption that everything you can do there will display correctly on an acceptable baseline only to find out later in testing that aspects need to be rebuilt. Caniuse presents a baseline assessment at any give time for particular functionality and if webflow could connect to that knowledgebase and present a tiny green amber or red circle on CSS functions the user could click to see a list of 'live' known issues related to the particular property etc. Maybe an unrealistic wish?

But to do this without messing with the styles of the existing site I need the css to be inherited from something else than body. So for an example if I could define the root element to be lets say <section class="w-body"></section> and the css was then "rooted" from there instead and any "reset css" should then be adjusted to exclude html tag references and body references should be "rooted" to the w-body instead... I know this might break some stuff but it would open for so many more usecases to our company.I myself am able to do this by changing the exported code but for my many non-code-capable co-workers this is not an option.

WEBFLOW-I-2880,Show price net of Taxes for B2B e-commerce,1,In the B2B world at least in Europe businesses don't count the VAT in what they pay. It is common sense that a price is displayed "+VAT" or other tax names for other countries (TVA in France IVA in Spain etc...).  Not having the possibility of showing the pricing without VAT means a visitor will think you are basically 20-21% more expensive than what you actually are. It is a massive business-block.  To sum it up: If my business sells something for 100€ to another business the final price their credit card is gonna pay is 100+Tax (say 20%) = 100+20 =120€. But they only care about the 100€ pricing as company don't pay these taxes in the end (they get them back from the state afterwards basically).,25/05/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2880

WEBFLOW-I-2858,Non recurring charges/invoices/bills,1,It would be very helpful to be able to create separate charges to clients other than the automatically recurring hosting costs.  I'll use my own situation as an example offering websites hosting and design as a service focusing primarily on small businesses as customers.  Many of these small business customers need their branding created because they are just getting started in this scenario being able to charge a custom one time amount would be helpful. Currently I need to bill a customer for this charge somewhere other than Webflow even though it's basically just a stepping stone to getting to Webflow and their website.  Then we get the website built and set up hosting with Webflow again the build of the site itself could be a separate one time bill aside from the monthly payment. (Let's say $1500 website design and development cost then $50/month to keep it hosted) as an example of what what I might tell the customer.  Now after the site is live inevitably customers are going to need updates and changes from time to time. Some will need constant additions/changes while others may just need to swap out a phone number or hours of operation twice a year. While some customers are willing to learn and have me teach them how to make these changes themselves many do not want to mess with it and still for more significant updates they will rely on me to make those changes. The current solution seems to be to mark up the monthly payment enough to cover estimated hours spent on the site each month.  This is fine for some clients but as I mentioned I'm working primarily with small businesses who are extremely price sensitive and often leave their sites untouched for years at a time (think local car washes small construction companies etc). That being said it would be more appealing to offer a lower monthly fee with the stipulation customers will be billed for additional hours spent down the road rather than just always having a high monthly payment even when time spent on maintenance and updates might be next to nothing on average.  Being able to create these separate charges would alleviate and allow better clarity in billing for the design and build phases as well as the maintenance and updates after launch while being more flexible on the fixed price for the customers. In addition it could allow us to itemize these expenses plus it would "feel" more trustworthy and professional if half the invoices/billing screens didn't come from Paypal (or wherever else) while the other half came from Webflow. The separation of these 2 payment types adds up in accounts/invoices/emails/taxes over time and while it isn't a huge problem it is a place I think the customer experience could become more streamlined and cohesive over time.,18/05/2020,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2858
WEBFLOW-I-608,Host the client billing payment form on a custom domain,2,Instead of webpayments.io (is a nice solution but...) it would be better to have the possibility like the custom domain for customer but here for us. Setting up a CNAME record pointing webpayments.io and charge our customers within our own full domain name that gives more trust to our customers and is more elegant and nice for us. For example "secure.example.com" when the customer receive the payment linkHere is an example --> http://d.pr/i/artd,07/04/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-608

I think having access to a new code editor panel could be helpful in a lot of scenarios:  Importing static website to Webflow and we could use this to add CMS to existing blocks.

WEBFLOW-I-509,Consider moving to or using Google Cloud,2,After yesterday's AWS outage it could be a good time to consider other options like Google Cloud. As the makers of Spanner and Kubernetes they know a thing or two about networks and cloud computing. GCP is easier to work with and manage. It's more developer friendly I hear. They offer simpler pricing too. For example while Google is constantly cutting prices AWS's reserved instances pricing fixes the same price for several years denying the flexibility and cost savings you're supposed to get with the cloud and tech improvements over time. This could eventually bring savings in costs that could mean lower hosting prices. https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/google-is-its-own-secret-weapon-in-the-cloud/http://www.businessinsider.com/google-diane-greene-secret-weapon-aws-2016-9http://www.recode.net/2017/3/1/14661126/snap-snapchat-ipo-spending-2-billion-google-cloud  https://cloud.google.com/files/esg-whitepaper.pdfhttps://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/12/measuring-cloud-performance-just-got-easier-and-better.html,02/03/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-509

Right now I have to go to the menu click around until I hit the correct element remove the class add the new one. If I could just go into the navigator click to replace the class and do so just by typing the new class name this tedious task can be done quicker.

WEBFLOW-I-2668,Visible/Hidden Style Control in the Pages Panel,1,When developing overlay pages accordion content or modals it often becomes necessary to hide those pages sections or elements using the Styles Panel property sheet. The thing is since those items are usually hidden at design time you can't just click on them in-line where the Styles Panel would be contextual. Instead you must navigate to the item using the Navigator Panel. Already each item has an icon that indicates if it is visible on the page or not but if you wish to make it visible so that you can make any changes you have to first select the item than go back over to tab over to the Styles Panel and scroll up to the visibility section. It would be far easier and more elegant if the indicator on the left Pages Panel acted more like a switch so that from right where the user has already navigated that object could be made visible and the user can proceed with the rest of the UI as normal then re-hide it just as easily. This is one of those rare instances where redundancy is actually simpler for the user. It would greatly improve the UX of working with hidden dynamic content at design time compared to having to navigate so much between the left and right panel groups just to inspect or modify a site element. ,17/03/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2668

This would assist in creating audiences in Google Analytics based on the searches that users have made; enhancing remarketing efforts usability and further insight into user experience.  For instance: I would like to create an audience in Google Analytics where the audience is built from user site searches. The method that I had in mind demands that I have “site search categories” setup. E.g someone searches “beagles”. Currently the URL would look something like this: coolwebsite.com/search?query=beagles   To create an audience in G.

Right now we have to enter each client and go to their billing history and download each of them. I had a client who stopped their subscription and when there's no active subscription I cannot any longer see their billing history super annoying when you have to file tax in EU. This means that I have to go back through emails where I also cannot see what my cut of the subscription was. We need one central place where you can see all previous billed customers even if they're not active any longer.

Which would be boss mode through Webflow.  So allow for setting of font sizes that can scale with the window (VW or VH) but have min and max sizes so they aren't crazy small for laptops or crazy big on 2k or 4K displays.  Currently I have to add custom CSS that sets minimum and maximum sizes with specific window min and max values as well.

WEBFLOW-I-2133,CMS data view in Dashboard,1,After using Wordpress for over a decade and moving to Webflow one of the most significant changes has been the way the CMS is managed. I enjoy the way it works currently but I firmly believe it could be much much better if the options to access manage and edit CMS content was increased. In other words I think giving access to the CMS on a separate page without going into the Designer would speed up work immensely. For instance in the image pictured if I could jump into the CMS from the dashboard I think my work would become faster and easier. Same can be said for the Gallery. There is ample room on each project in the dashboard for these buttons. The improvements would be magical. Please consider moving them into plans. To summarize giving users access to the CMS without going into the Designer or Editor is a must because Webflow has moved into E-commerce. While I don't use that feature I use the CMS intensively. I think there may be missed value for Webflow's customers to enrich the system for the CMS and the dashboard is the place to make this happen.,09/07/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2133

So you will have to create two sections one that is visible on desktop and one that is visible on mobile.  This solution works great but: when a client is editing content on desktop this content won't change on the mobile section. Because of the two different sections.  I really hope to be able to 'Get text from' on a static page so desktop and mobile content will change together when edited.

WEBFLOW-I-2103,Hosting subscription linked to domain rather then specific webflow site.,1,Instead of paying hosting fee for a specific webflow site it would be more beneficial to pay hosting fee for a specific domain. Like that when a redesign goes online replacing a current website already hosted within webflow we are not faced with paying new hosting costs. Also good for convincing clients to stay within the webflow environment. For me the main reason for wanting this is that for our biggest client we are publishing updated content each week. Working in editor mode in a sandboxed copy of the live website. With the current hosting structure it is not possible to unpublish last weeks version and publish this weeks version without paying a full month of hosting costs even though the website is hosted under the same domain.,24/06/2019,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2103

This included things like being able to apply poster images skin controls and so forth. The video tools in Webflow are just way too basic and lacklustre to be honest - this is one area that needs focus  - There might be times where you want to for example wish to disable video controls until a video is selected for playback as your poster image on Vimeo might have text at the bottom etc. Yes I know that Vimeo poster images work in Webflow however these are compressed in ways where the clarity goes out of the window hence the need for customised video posters.

It's the most common option I select and I'm sure many others do as well. It makes no sense placing it at the very bottom of the list and having to scroll down every single time. I believe this tiny tweak would allow many designers to work faster and more efficiently.Admin Note:It's unlikely that we'll move the "All Properties" transition to the top of the transition selection list because it is much more performant to add transition easing methods to each specific attribute rather than all of them (which causes many unnecessary browser operations to run if this route is selected).,23/12/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1684

WEBFLOW-I-1532,Separate Site Configuration & Hosting setup from Billing,1,Currently Webflow attaches all configuration aspects of Hosting to the Billing status. If billing is canceled all of the configuration is wiped out. Before billing & hosting are established many of the important pre-launch configuration steps cannot be performed. In further detail these are the two main problems we face; 1 - If Billing is canceled all hosting and configurations settings are completely *wiped out* This just happened to us for the first time today on a major client due to a corporate merger. We woke up to their website down all host names deleted all redirects deleted all billing history deleted - and had to completely setup billing and hosting again completely from scratch. Most of this is doable in short order but certain elements like the list of redirects for their marketing brochures billboard campaigns etc. are entirely gone and don't exist anywhere else. ( This brings up a separate issue that these configuration settings should be part of the site backup ) 2 - We cannot configure host names or redirects until after billing and hosting are activated. The current experience for us is... build the website setup client hosting wait some unknown number of days for them to get around to entering their credit card billing details... then urgently and as quickly as possible try to setup all of the domain names redirects and hosting settings needed to bring the site live.   PREFERRED DESIGN Allow all hosting configuration to be done fully including host names and redirects prior to the hosting being switched on. Save all configuration data as part of the site backup. Allow it to be viewed read-only in the backup history. Client accounts are created and remembered independently of billing. If a card fails 3 times the client is not deleted- the site is simply unpublished and they are forced to enter a new card before the site is publishable again. New cards can be added / replaced at any time. At no point is that Client account or billing history ever deleted. See https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1533 At no point is any data lost including billing history if the billing is canceled. All DNS records and hosting configurations are created outside of Webflow however we'd like to note that configuring 301 re-directs would be a very useful feature before adding a site plan to a project.,29/10/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1532

WEBFLOW-I-1510,Add text render options,1,It would be super duper if we could change the text rendering of the typography in the Designer view. I know Its simple to just add one line of custom code but as a designer I don't have all the basic knowledge of truthfully translate a design to code (and thats why i use Webflow). Until I stumbled upon this setting I was furious about how bad web typography renders (twice as bold as the sketch design). I know a lot of designers who's frustrated about the text rendering on the web never matching the typography thats been rendered from sketch/xd or photoshop. Almost no one heard about the css text rendering option. Surprisingly a lot of web devs never bother with it either when they translate a design to code.,18/10/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1510

WEBFLOW-I-1482,Easier way to change padding/margin,1,The idea is pretty simple: to be able to select either padding/margin in the UI (as you can currently do) but then to be able to add a value which effects all parameters selected. So a minimal change but I feel it would make the process of adding funky values to different areas a bit more intuitive and streamlined. You would just have one value box in the centre which would show the value of the highlighted areas of margin/padding. To adjust some areas but not others you would need to select or deselect as appropriate. Hope this makes sense...please don't make me do a diagram.

WEBFLOW-I-1479,CMS Driven Page Counter,1,I'm designing an individual page view driven by the CMS  so a specific link will direct to a page that is automatically populated by a specific data base. It would be nice to have two versions of counter. A simple one that is.  One tabulates the number of times that page is viewed unlimited and can be reset by hitting the clear counter within the CMS data input area and the unique IP driven counter so no matter if the one person viewing the page multiple times it is counted as one for that individually reviewing that CMS templated page over and over. It can be visible or invisible which can be toggled within the CMS data entry.  But can also be added to the static page as well a nifty module,03/10/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1479

WEBFLOW-I-1244,Quality of Life improvements to multi-ref tags (Sort/Filter/Color/Tag?),1,Hey all I run alistofawards.com which is heavy on multi-ref tagging. I've attached a photo of what some of my award pages look like in the editor with multireference fields. At the moment I have 400+ categories of competitions. Some competitions include all of them minus one section - like architecture categories. I know you're thinking just make another multireference field to add those specific ones. But that would make me have a different collection list which complicates/doesn't allow me to filter/display those tags in other pages -- I need them to all be in one collection. Some competitions cross boundaries and because I can't really reference another collection in a collection page it gets very tricky. So keeping them in one collection has kept me sane. What I'm curious about is being able to color tags - or easily tag tags (lol I know meta and probably not the right direction). Think MAC folders - how you can color a folder or file by right clicking. This is just a thought I know most users won't run into the issue having to take out some of the tags. It may be helpful in the upcoming E-commerce sites though. Another suggestion maybe take the purple out of these tags so i can more easily scan the text in tags for the ones I need. It is a little hard on the eyes with this many. You could just outline the tags in grey maybe? I want to stick this note to the board as it may be more helpful when robust e-commerce sites come available too.BestColin,09/05/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1244

WEBFLOW-I-1187,Extra tab in showcase for the "Most Liked" project this week month year all-time ect.,1,With the regular updates being made to Webflow (which I love btw) there are times when something new is rolled out and I no longer know how to build certain elements. This is especially true with interactions. I know I can ask a question in the forums and get a quick response but I also like to reverse engineer projects to see how things work. The problem with doing this within the showcase (as of now) is I need to organize by recent go page by page and click on every project that has a fair amount of likes clones and/or views to see if they built what I am looking to replicate. Alternatively if I organize by 'most liked' or 'most viewed' chances are they are using legacy interactions and outdated tools. Adding a tab to the 'most liked' tab to organize by most liked this week month year ect would greatly cut down the time it takes me to search for these types of projects.

I don't have a web design background but I find the Sliders in Thrive Architect to be a tremendous help for determining length and width of any element I use to build my site. Instead of guessing with pixels I just use the sliders to size my elements easily visually. These work for sections font containers images and etc. I think it is a phenomenal asset for beginner to intermediate users. Webflow should incorporate these Sliders to improve Webflow's ease of use and to raise confidence for people who are less technical using specific units.,27/03/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1174

WEBFLOW-I-973,Class Changing Across All Instances,1,The idea behind this is that you can change all instances of a certain class to a new class so long as both classes belong to the same element.  An example would be two H2 element classes: "H2a" and "H2b" both with completely different styling to them. Let's say your website currently has fifty H2a instances. But what if you wanted to see what your website looked like if they were H2b instances instead? You'd have to either change all the styling in the H2a class to what H2b has (and change it back to H2a when you're done) or you'd have to manually go through each H2a instance and change it to H2b. Both are extremely tedious. A much simpler solution would be an option in the tools somewhere to change all H2a class instances to H2b instances.  This opens up the door for tremendous possibilities.

WEBFLOW-I-911,Get rid of the "Feedback Category" in the community forum.,1,Why? feed·backˈfēdˌbak/Submitnounnoun: feedback The word Feedback is a catch-all term and consists of everything a user tells the company from bugs to wishlist ideas. If not used in the dictionary defined way the use of this forum category page title is confusing for users that are trying to give feedback. Asking users to give feedback but arbitrarily discriminate between types of feedback (bug reports kudos suggestions questions etc…) is asking them to jump through cognitive hoops to know if what they have to say should be posted here there or somewhere else and is unacceptable.  Good Solution: IF the feedback page is no longer being used for general purpose feedback a “catch-all” as the term is defined above don’t title the category feedback… change the name to something more specific that it is intended to represent. Simply Define better categories and get rid of the catch-all "Feedback" category. It will save everyone from a headache.  Bad Solution: The quote in the Guidelines for posting to the feedback category pinned post “Please do not use this category for new feature requests/suggestions/discussions. We have an app for that!” is hard to see as the last line of the post and its arbitrary nature creates a lot of uncertainty about what the feedback category page is actually for.,29/09/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-911
WEBFLOW-I-889,One 'Content Editor' For All Projects on 'Designer Pro Plan' ($42/month) Plz,1,As it stands - there is no price promotion on hosting plans when upgrading from a "Designer Lite Plan" to a "Designer Pro Plan"  I am not suggesting a "price promotion" instead i'd like to see an added "feature promotion" when upgrading designer plans. The feature would allow "Designer Pro Plans" to have at least one "Content Editor" on all projects - including those sites being hosted under the "Basic Hosting" plans. https://webflow.com/pricing/designer-plans Currently only the "CMS Hosting" allows for content editors. Three of them. But I am a two man operation and will be so in the foreseeable future. I'm the developer and I work with a content creator. Since the "Basic Hosting" plan offers 100 static pages it would be nice to have an option where I can have a content creator add/edit on the frontend while I'm developing on the backend on any number of ongoing projects. No offense Webflow great tools yet confusing plans. A lot of your pricing seems arbitrary. If a two man operation makes the commitment to purchase the "Designer Pro Plan" ( & we have no choice having already exceeding the 10 project limit) -- And if I am already purchasing several "CMS Hosting Plans" as well as several "Basic Hosting Plans" -- and all I need is one "Content Editor" for all my projects why must I purchase "CMS Hosting" for individual projects in order to maintain a daily efficient workflow?  I feel like I'm being nicked & dimed. By making us more efficient instead of what I am doing now: wasting time splitting hairs over your ' two tiered pricing plans' would make you more money in the end as my partner & I will be able to pump out more sites and take on more clients.  Thank you. #Freedoooommmm #moreflowplz Much Appreciation Joe D.,19/09/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-889

WEBFLOW-I-843,Emergency plan if designer/freelancer goes Awol,1,An odd one this but as a freelancer I have been asked the question often. 'What happens if you die/become disabled in some way?' This is a non-issue for a company; others carry on but for an individual freelancer it can be a showstopper. A contributor suggested this could be a very easy addition to the account settings - with a simple list of customers and contact details per account. If as I suspect the first thing Webflow notices is that subs aren't paid any more then websites hosted by Webflow would be suspended. In this case it would make sense that Webflow contact the customer and offer continuing Webflow hosting from that point. The second scenario is where a website is created in Webflow but hosted elsewhere. Here again Webflow should be able to contact the customer and offer ongoing hosting. In both cases it would make sense for Webflow to provide an alternative designer for the customer. Samliew suggested this morning that the client would need to contact Support in these circumstances but I think this idea would be a cleaner and easier alternative.,10/08/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-843

For example if I wanted to stagger elements on the page left and right I want the first 2 elements to go on the left then right. Currently in webflow I have to repeat the same element and can't set a second element inside the content loop to get passed the next consecutive element to make for one iteration. The content wrapper should pass in as many elements as you need PER ITERATION. So that each iteration we can leverage as many consecutive elements to decorate the loop as we need with UI/UX.

WEBFLOW-I-279,An Adobe CC/Salesforce-esque Licensed Application,1,There were similar requests posted on the ‘Wishlist’ but I just had to express my hope and concern.  I’m looking for a long-term fault-tolerant solution for web design and development.  There’s no backup environment to ensure my company and that of my client’s web presence can continue with minimal disruption if Webflow was to sell the company close the business or even if the platform is inaccessible due to a network outage.  A web based application is wonderful but I see a future need to manage a hosted environment with a client application (hopefully Webflow) in my localized market to fully support my small business client’s technological and design needs.  I’m trying to build a greater web presence for my clients but there’s no fault tolerant environment that will allow continuing operations during a presumed outage or company change.  A licensed Webflow downloadable software application similar to Adobe’s Creative Cloud and/or Salesforce would be helpful for my client’s web presence and that of my own.  I know this request possibly changes Webflow’s business model and strategy… I’m just spit balling and again it’s a concern I’ll need to address at some point as my client base grows.  I really do love Webflow as a platform and I hope to build many more sites in the future.

WEBFLOW-I-242,Better inform client of failed credit card payments,1,Basically if we're using the Webflow Client billing and for whatever reason the credit card gets cancelled or it fails there should be a system in place to account for this. Example: A client cancels the payment without telling anyone so the first thing that happens should be an email sent out to the client and to the agency or designer. Saying that "if not paid within 3 days the service will end and your website will be locked". Ideally there should be an email each day until that point. On the 3rd day there should be a site-wide white-labled lockout screen urging the owner to call the agency or designer to get the service back online. That would be great and it would allow many people to scale their agencies or companies very easily.,24/01/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-242

WEBFLOW-I-82,Preview of Selector Style,1,It would be really cool to see the effect of a selector style on the element before you select it the selector name. In other words if you select an element (Div Section etc) then say the item is a Header item then you type out "Header" in the selector list to reveal all the available header styles then you could go through them and see what your element will look like. Instead of going through them one by one. You already do this when replacing an image and cycling through the images in the image library. I feel this would make choosing the correct style much quicker and also help nail down styles that need a global tweak.,18/01/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-82

WEBFLOW-I-4923,specific affordable prices in the currency of emerging countries,0,Okay I know I know webflow is awesome!  It has suitable plans and offers excellent tools and resources for many (comma) but this is for countries with currencies equivalent to the US dollar or the euro... Webflow has grown a lot year after year and has embraced a relevant market on the Internet.  However from my point of view I need to make the difficult statement that prices are inaccessible to a significant range of potential Webflow users around the world.  So I a brazilian who wants to use all the resources of Webflow am here facing this huge budget barrier.  The comparison between the American Dollar and the Real (Brazilian currency) is soooo high nowadays it is on the basis of 1 to 6 on average. But not only that. The average hourly rate for a professional here in Brazil is on the basis of 25 to 30 Real per hour that is from 4 to 5 Dollars per hour 8.5K Dollars per year against a base of 50K to 80K in the average (or much more) of designers working in those countries.  So an entire market is affected because of this difference. For example: Brazilians are perhaps one of the people who use the Internet the most in the world. According to the latest official census we are around 150 million Brazilians (over 15 years of age) using the Internet for various purposes. Solutions like wordpress wix and other Webflow competitors command our market even though they are so complicated to use. Other than that many companies choose to develop their own information systems "by hand".  It would be great for Webflow customers in a utopian world if the price were for example 19 or 34... yes without the currency sign... that is regardless of currency.  I brought this issue with this data and perspective to suggest that Webflow starts to lead the market in emerging countries with the simple alternative of specific affordable prices in their currency.,10/03/2022,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4923

WEBFLOW-I-4342,IX2 "scroll in view" refinement,0,I imagine by now many of you have used the "while scrolling through view" functionality on Webflow. The issue with the current implementation is it works very few parameters not giving you much flexibility. Let's say for example that you have a blog with an hero area introducing the article that is the height of 600px and starts at the top of the screen. This is a layout that is used very often (example: http://themenectar.com/demo/salient-blog-dark/we-encountered-a-true-paradise/). Currently this isn't possible in Webflow as you would have to calculate the percentage from the bottom of the viewport which isn't consistent from screen to screen. The other option I've seen people do is apply the parallax effect to the page but in a CMS setting such as a blog it's not possible to determine the height of the page. A tool I have used previously is called basicScroll (https://basicscroll.electerious.com/) this has a very good way of defining how you would like the parallax to be calculated (https://github.com/electerious/basicScroll#start-and-stop-position). I believe that this implementation of how Webflow calculates an element scrolling through the viewport would vastly improve what people can do within Webflow.

The problem being that a referenced cms isn't always as useful. for instance you have a project and some have say 3 sections and others need 5. you could make a seperate collection with the sections and then link them to the project but that gets messy really fast.

WEBFLOW-I-3372,Boxed CMS post body editing with larger font,0,The biggest gripe I have with Webflow at the moment is editing content within Webflow using the horrible CMS post body editor layout.

Take a look at the WordPress post editing experience when compared with Webflow CMS post body editing. Wordpress 580px width boxed editor 16px font size Webflow 2155px on my ultra-wide screen wraps according to screen resolution. 12px font size Workaround for now is to use the Chrome device toolbar (F12) to shrink the resolution to 1000px width and zoom in 150%. ,30/09/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3372

This will be handy with shipping companies that require a phone number. Like UPS. I can see from Apple's documentation that it is possible to require a phone number through Apple Pay (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/applepaycontactfield) i imagine that this is the same with the other quick pay options.,22/09/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3327
WEBFLOW-I-3314,Invisible character detection and management features,0,I'm finding that a huge challenge with collaborating with clients in the CMS  and E-commerce systems is that they don't have a concept of what damage extra invisible characters do to a layout. So I can obsess all I want about the spacing after a rich text field but they might leave three or four hard returns after their text that move the next item 60 pixels down the page. As much as I try to be an educator this is simply just something that non-designers never think about so it would be good if the CMS and E-commerce did some of this automatically or at least showed people what invisible characters were there. You could highlight in red any doubles with a hover explanation of why they will throw off the design nudging them into better behavior. Or you could simply not print the second of any of these characters to the page which would be my preference. The most important would be automatically disregarding any return characters at the end of a block of text. If you look at a CMS entry these are almost impossible to see and do the most damage to layouts as they actually move elements outside of the text box. They are also probably the easiest to program an automated editor to remove.,18/09/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3314

WEBFLOW-I-2804,Editable Styling For Symbols (component),0,I see components as the way a site gets built but they are inflexible. For example I built a hero component with text and a background image. The image was light text dark. But if I change the image to a darker color the text is unreadable. I had to create 2 versions of the component.  Allow option for editors / developers using component to at least change a style (and in general allow more options): in this common and simple component change the text from black to say white. Could be options that the designer / developer sets.  Would also be useful to be able to saw switch text and images in a grid column so image could be right or left hand side.  These are very common usages. In the examples above I would need 4 variations of the same component/ symbol. Better is one symbol with option to change image from left to right and change text from dark to light. ,01/05/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2804

WEBFLOW-I-2612,Dynamic Style Settings for adding plain text as a class to a div,0,When I build websites in Wordpress of Craft I often add conditions or href links to specific ID's or Classes in a collection or for loop. When needing to target specific divs (for revealing or specifying particular divs via js for example) it would be great and very beneficial to add text to each item in a collection. Let's say you want to specify which day a specific menu item shows up that every Monday it shows up via js. It would be great for a rich text field to have a wrapper with the specific text as a class attached to it. So based on a choice field it would add the tag to that particular item. I know you can basically do this with the html embed. But that means we need the html for the entire item not just the wrapper.,27/02/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2612
WEBFLOW-I-2605,Add descriptions/help text to CMS Collections,0,When creating a CMS Collection field I love being able to add the help text as it helps the client understand what the field is for and how they should use it. What would be amazing is carrying this idea over for the overall CMS Collection so that a client can in the same manner understand what the collection does and how they should use it. For simple sites this may not be necessary but for instance I have one client site with 14 different CMS Collections and even though I ran through each one with them they will periodically come back and ask how things work as they keep forgetting. Having the ability to add a simple description at the top of each CMS Collection that displays in the Editor would be awesome! :),25/02/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2605

Something like this would be ideal. One click to immediately open up the page. In the mean time if the Pages panel could actually scroll to the page I'm on that would be greaaaat.

And its never perfect with all the different media resolutions out there. If you set the image to 100% width it would have been very nice if I could just set the height to a specific aspect ratio of the width directly in Webflow. e.g. the height of the image should always be 65% of the image width used in the browser. Its possible with custom code but it would be a nice feature to have in Webflow too.  Admin Note:This is currently possible with background images by setting bottom or top padding to a percentage on an element with a background set (such as 50%).

WEBFLOW-I-2066,Bypass CSS and write directly into HTML code,0,NOT to be confused with Custom Embed Code. There are numerous instances where it makes more sense to write properties directly into HTML instead of a css/class. For example I don't want to make a NEW CSS class name for  '<'p'>'<'font size="20px"'>'This is some text!'<'/font'>'<'/p'>' This is some text! I simply want that particular paragraph element to be 20px in HTML without making new class-name. Basically a good way to incorporate this is using the existing Style Panel with a 'Bypass CSS' pill toggle which Style panel writes directly into HTML without css.

Solutions: They could just give someone access to their whole account but it could be projects in there they don't want anyone to see and they also don't want change password every time they want to restrict access. When sharing a read-only-link you get a option to share it with another webflow user maybe someone with a pro account. With that link that person can make changes to the actual site.

Or you often work with the same couple of pages and you want to have them at hand. Right now the only way to navigate within pages is by using the page selector panel.When you have a lot of pages it can become a pain.

WEBFLOW-I-1259,Ability to lock a page settings panel so that it remains open,0,This applies to the five panel which can be toggled open / closed in the page settings i.e: When I'm updating page settings (normally when I'm nearly finished a site) I'll normally do a lot of pages at once - or I'll do one final check to ensure that all the pages been configured correctly. However each time I click into a different page I have to toggle open the relevant page setting panel which is annoying and time consuming - especially if there are lots of pages on the site. I propose that the user should be able to click some lock symbol at the top of the relevant panel to lock that panel section open - this will lock this panel open for all pages - and then the user can unlock it so that it will close for all pages. The current situation is slow and not user friendly - especially on larger sites as I mentioned.,16/05/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1259

I am thinking this would require an array of elements that have been premade in the designer for editor user selection. Maybe it's an array that is selectable in the rich text field type or it's a new field type. The example of where this would be useful is in specific element interactions or wrapping elements in custom code (like social sharing) that only effect the specific piece of content.,20/02/2018,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1127

WEBFLOW-I-1058,Longer dropdowns for style property settings and smarter selection for Transitions,0,We use the Transitions options all the time. The dropdown list is very short and you have to carefully scroll down inside of it looking for the right option. Most likely you'll have to repeat that 2 or 3 times if you have a fine-tuned behavior (bg color text color Transform for a button). Sometimes you'll have to do it more than that if you make subtle changes in shadows borders etc. 1. To begin with a longer list completely unfolded would be cool. 2. Being able to multi-select inside of it would be even cooler3. And if the list was putting on top the Transitions you use the most or the Transitions WF thinks you're going to use (like the ones you've actually styled for the selected element) it would be rad.It doesn't have to be a long list like the new IX2 lists of animations presets. It could be a side sub-panel. Only custom easing curves use a side sub-panel in Webflow. That's unfortunate because I think this UI pattern works great and prevent lists to be too vertical.I've attached an image.

WEBFLOW-I-989,Favorites in the Template Store,0,When creating a new project and selecting a starting point or template it would be quite useful to be able to mark top available templates as a Favorite. There should also be "Favorites" view in the "Or choose a template" filter selector i.e. "All   Free   Premium   Favorites"  The thumbnails should also show a heart icon on the top-right to indicate and toggle Favorited status. While in the Favorites view if user Unfavorites a given template a confirmation modal should appear and the thumbnail should disappear from the view if user confirms removal from Favorites. In all other views the toggle would simply change the indicator between an on and off state without a modal and without removing the thumbnail from the active view. Not only would this vastly improve the UX of shopping for and narrowing down a final template selection for a given project but I believe it will ultimately motivate more template sales with designers over the long term because top choices will always be easily accessible rather than starting the shopping experience over again with every new session like the user is a stranger to Webflow. Speaking for myself each time I start a new Webflow project I often find more than one template that catches my eye but of course I ultimately only chose one for a given project. Favorites would allow the shopping experience to resume and deepen over time by always keeping top candidates close at hand rather than lost in the shuffle or forgotten altogether.

WEBFLOW-I-767,Add New Atomic Element on Dropdown or Keystroke,0,I've been bouncing back and forth between Sketch and Webflow a lot and thought of an idea that might make sense while Webflow is hopefully working on a way to incorporate Atomic Design into the platform. At the end of the day everything on the UI should fall into one of those categories and should be a symbol that can be synced across all instances and overridden at any time per-instance. The idea is to make it easier to add elements to the page through two methods: 1. Faster Dropdown-style menu directly on the top navbar for easy browsing between Atoms Organisms Molecules etc. 2. Using a Shift+CMD+A keystroke you can prompt a nice UI to search for the element you want to add and it yields up to your pointer.

You have cut me off seemingly over night and are forcing me to pay twice as much or more for seemingly less value or at most no real additional value – just utter confusion!!? I have been using Webflow for years as an early adopter and have reffered plenty of customers to you. And now you have locked me out of my projects forcing me to delete some of my learning projects to free you up some space and I still can't even create a project that would have actually turned into a paying customer. Your pricing structures have always been confusing and now they just get even more confusing. To add to my dissapointment your support is even slower whilst I am already paying $24pm+ literally for no benefit right now.So I hope you can see how you/Webflow is putting me in an awkward spot. I'm enclined to delete my account all together now and end my subscription because your new pricing and restrictions are frankly confusing and unfair.

WEBFLOW-I-1430,Better Social Share Buttons,4,The Issue: Adding the option to create social share buttons would be great. I understand we have Twitter Facebook and Google Plus. But they lack design flexibility and the current method of using embedded code is an extra step away from the purpose of Webflow: to easily see and adapt your design/workflow. We know how important social shares contribute to link building and rankings so it would be great to see them be taken more seriously.  Potential Solution: Provide a Social Media Link Element. It won't be styled. Instead it will be an option just like the Link Block Element. You can choose which social platform to share to (Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr Google + and so on) and whether it be in a new tab or a pop-up window. For example designers can then add this box to a div with their Font Awesome Twitter icon.

Would love to be able to edit any public website's html or css using a webflow chrome extension so I can screenshot or save html/css for a developer to implement similar to Google Chrome's Inspect Tool but user friendly. It doesn't have to be a production ready code but just a shortcut to screenshotting a website and pasting into photoshop to cut up.

A fairly good example to follow is the way drag'n'drop has been implemented in TreeDBNotes (http://www.mytreedb.com).It is also necessary to have buttons with arrows for moving an element across parents and siblings. In some cases moving elements by drag'n'drop is not that easy especially for new users.  TreeDBNotes (http://www.mytreedb.com)'s implementation again is good to follow..It'd be great to have shortcuts for adding new elements (as children) so as to spare us dragging from the left side of the screen.,13/02/2017,None,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-438

WEBFLOW-I-4738,Keyboard shortcuts to focus on Navigator and Style panels,1,I try to use keyboard shortcuts whenever possible.  It would be helpful to me if there were two new keyboard shortcuts.  One would put the focus on the Body element for the current page as shown in the navigator.  I could then use the arrow keys to navigate up and down the tree.  Currently if I'm in the Style panel I have to do a mouse click to get to the Navigator.  I know I can use the 'z' key to get over there but that's a roundabout way of doing it since it will close the navigator and I have to hit 'z' again to reopen it.  The second keyboard short cut would be similar.  It would always put the focus in the Selector section of the Style panel.  Once there I can tab down through the various attributes.

Eased gradients are being worked on by a few passionate designers (links below) because they will make for a more beautiful web—which I think is webflow's goal. That's what I've been using it for anyway :) Here is a detailed explanation of how eased transitions are ubiquitous in the digital and physical world—curves we think of as ""round"" are actually eased into each other so the curvature is continuous.

WEBFLOW-I-1607,Triggering an interaction with code (and vise versa),3,"Example 1: After creating a full-page fancy confirmation overlay animation with the new interactions it would be nice to be able to have that animation begin when some input is submitted and is executed successfully in the back-end. In this case JS code would be waiting for the confirmation from the back-end and will then trigger the animation to start (i.e. there would be no way to trigger this as a user without having received the confirmation from the back-end) Example 2: Imagine a complex animation that the user needs to see every time but the last few parts of that animation need to be shown once (i.e. the animation needs to stop short of finishing if there's a page refresh). Using JS and session tokens you set up to functions called seenAnimation which returns true or false. Now you can add a step in your animation calling seenAnimation during the animation run time. The attributes would be ""continue if function returns true"" and ""stop animation if function returns false"".",16/11/2018,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1607

WEBFLOW-I-4528,Projects that are unposted and clone-able should not count towards customers' project allowance.,1,I don't understand why you only allow 2 or 10 projects in your lower-tier account plans.  Doesn't this limit the clonable projects you will see in the showcase section?  Just imaging for a moment all projects which are uploaded to the webflow subdomain and offered as a clonable project would not count towards customers' project allowance.  Wouldn't you think there would be more creators willing to upload clonable projects? What would be if there would be hundreds or even thousands of high-quality colanable projects people can use as a starting point to create their own projects from?  I have been using Elementor & Squarespace both have amazing templates but are extremely limited in terms of what you can do past the templates but if you could offer great templates (properly working clones) as a starting point and have all the customisation capabilities your platform already has you would blow them all out of the water.

For example the ""Hero"" layout currently has text on the left and an image on the right. That's the only hero option you can choose from. It would be great to make ""Heros"" a category and then within that category the ability to choose from the following layouts: ""Hero: Right Image"" ""Hero: Centered Image"" ""Hero: Left Image"" etc. Another example: For the ""Sticky Nav"" category have ""Sticky Nav: Left Logo with Right Navlinks"" ""Sticky Nav: Left Logo with Centered Navlinks"" and ""Sticky Nav: Centered Logo with Left-Right Navlinks"" etc. ",07/07/2021,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-4358

I am a windows user but when I had Apple I used Firefox because it had more customizable security features than safari. I've used chrome before and did not enjoy the constant malware and fake security sweeps I kept getting. Against my better judgement I downloaded chrome again so I could use your editor and again I got malware and fake security alerts. I deleted chrome and now use Microsoft Edge but when I need to edit my site I dig the old MacBook out of the closet and use safari.

WEBFLOW-I-3377,Allow items in list wrappers,1,When you drag out any type of CMS or product grid you are essentially given several parent divs that do nothing but hold the div inside them. While I've wondered why we need so many it has largely been not a big problem. What is more confusing though and a wasted opportunity is that you can't put anything else in those divs. The reason I think we should be able to is because once this is attached to a CMS or product list that we could use conditional visibility based on the items within the list. For example I am working on a template page that has three grids containing products that are sorted both for that page and for the individual grid. Above each grid is a label denoting what products are in that section. This is working great until one of the sections is empty then I have a label with nothing under it. If it was nested in the hierarchy of the grid I could use conditional visibility but as it is I can't because the condition it needs is within the grid (which is a sibling element and not a parent) not the page. Additionally it would be tidier to be able to have things in here as it would make this more of a self contained unit and would allow layouts to have fewer items.,01/10/2020,Reviewed,https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3377
