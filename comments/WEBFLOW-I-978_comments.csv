28/06/2018,Luca,It would be great indeed. Fluid typography should be a must but strangely enoughÂ the design community has never paid much attention to it. I remember a fantastic JS ilbrary that could do that called flowtype.js. I've done some research but eventually found it almost impossible to figure out how to make layouts truly responsive with fluid typography that adapts dynamically so the number of words per line remains approximately the same and the protportion between text and image is preserved.
