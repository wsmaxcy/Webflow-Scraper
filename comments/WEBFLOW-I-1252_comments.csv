22/01/2022,Julieta Ascar,I can't do this in webflow in a "no code" way:https://www.oscarbony.com/obras/seleccion/#slide16
22/01/2022,Julieta Ascar,Not having this is simplz ridiculous. I build websites for artists. I need to be able to fully customize the appearance of the gallery lightbox and I need to be able to add rich text captions (artwork name is always italic). I can't do all this in Webflow PLEASE!
18/10/2019,Joe Russell,This is also an issue for accessibility - parts of the default set of Webflow elements can be customised to be made fully accessible. The lightbox currently can't be!
10/01/2019,Urs Westermann,Agree! At the moment it's very limited to change the appearence of the lightbox.
