02/03/2022,Neville,I am just completing a multi-currency event management app for a client - and I've had to cobble it together with various different components (Webflow Airtable and Stripe included) because there isn't multi-currency support in Webflow.
30/01/2022,David Howlett,I cannot move my ecommerce business to webflow simply because we cannot sell in multiple currencies. How can you offer an ecommerce package without basic functionality?!
11/01/2022,Studio Noue,E-commerce without multiple currencies are useless.
05/12/2021,Studio Noue,Can't believe Webflow doesn't have this functionalities. Basically that means no international e-commerce. It's so bad. 3 years later still nothing.
13/07/2021,Jessy,Multiple currencies is an absolute must for Ecommerce sites. This is the single overriding factor influencing my decision to switch platforms.
22/06/2021,Sjoerd,it is essential if you sell courses etc. worldwide to have multi currency. The sooner the better.
14/06/2021,Monto.io,We recently launched Multi-Currency for Webflow Shops to automatically translate prices to your shoppers' home currencies. Please give it a try for free!
11/06/2021,Kelsie Trainor,Definitely need this feature ASAP!!!!
25/05/2021,Erfan Amiri,Need this feature!!! Hopefully as soon as possible...
16/05/2021,Yasin Mahmood,Desperately need this feature! Our e-commerce store is worldwide.
10/04/2021,Tobias Wagner,Currently amounts are converted on the fly using current exchange rates. However for an effective last phase of a sales funnel it’s really important to set meaningful pricing in local currencies. You would not want to display €10.24 but €9.99. You’d rather take the hit and lose the 0.25c but convert at much higher rates.
24/03/2021,Sjoerd Taal,This is better something they add fast this is so important when you have a store that sells wordwide.. :(
16/03/2021,Francois Carlier,I'm horrified to see that this feature has been requested in April 2019 and is still not implemented. I guess it will never be as well as customer portal. I'm on the fence to quit Webflow.
26/02/2021,Hanna Braun,This would be so helpful!!!
01/02/2021,Ajda Zup,We really need this!
19/11/2020,Carl Heinrichs,Please add this feature!
19/11/2020,Joel,Multiple currencies is a deal breaker for my client. We cannot use Webflow ecommerce on the lack of this feature alone and it's disappointing to see that it has been ignored for so long especially considering its already implemented on Wix and Shopify.
03/11/2020,Gary J,Come on! Webflow provide us this feature.
23/10/2020,Carl Heinrichs,Must have!
