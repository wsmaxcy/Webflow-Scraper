20/06/2018,Scottie J. Haines,If you mean to make it so that if you directly right-click on a navigation button there is an option to show the drop-down div (or even a keyboard shortcut) then I'm onboard for that. Having to go to the settings panel to open a drop-down menu is a pain if you are working with custom div drop-downs.
