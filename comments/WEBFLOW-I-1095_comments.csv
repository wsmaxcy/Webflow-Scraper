17/05/2021,Daniel Cobb Jr,That's exactly what we're dealing with. It's hard to explain how Webflow works to the client without getting them frustrated either. This is a flaw that definitely needs to work out in the future.
05/05/2021,Amy Blacketter,Yeah this has pretty much caused our agency immense amount of headaches over the last year. Clients want more access to adjust or edit their pages than the editor allows and need Designer access. We then have to make them buy a NEW account potenially loosing money they paid for their hosting fees to setup a new hosting plan and then we have to transfer the site to them. Then if we want to ever make edits we have to login to their account. Utterly ridiculous.
11/02/2021,Andy Johnston,Please. This seems basic. I need to collaborate on a site with another designer. But I can't simultaneously allow them access to all sites as they are not part of my in-house team.
25/10/2020,Miek Thompson,I need this. My main issue is hosting.

11/03/2020,Paul Seymour,Unfortuneatly I'm out of votes. But I have only one client wtih Webflow and they insisted premetively that they "own" their own site. So in order to access their Designer (which they don't even use) I have to login with the email address they set up for me via their own company. Kinda goofy.
16/09/2019,Chris Sammarone,WEBFLOW-I-712 – We have been having the EXACT same issue. This idea should not have been merged with WEBFLOW-I-1095 because I don't want to transfer sites to other accounts and lose ability to charge for monthly hosting and edits
