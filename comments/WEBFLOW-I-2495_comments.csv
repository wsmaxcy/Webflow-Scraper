16/04/2022,Kasper Dam,We're right now resorting toUsing "SKU" for inputting "Delivery time"Using "Download file name" for "Variant Description"
20/02/2022,Parham Shafti,Any progress on this? This should be a no-brainer and a very needed feature for various product categories.
20/02/2022,Mnngful Publishing,The variant Description field is critical. And really simple to deliver.

21/03/2021,Devon,This would be great! Going to need to spend quite some time writing around this

18/01/2021,Guest,I have multiple variants of some products but would like to choose the fields for the variant. I don't need Height Length or Weight for each variant but a fields like "Description" or "Speed" or "Memory" or some other specification/attribute unique to the variant. Allowing the creation of Custom Variant Fields would enable selling items with detailed specifications that vary among different tiers of a product i.e. A laptop with different hard drive sizes or memory capacities.
