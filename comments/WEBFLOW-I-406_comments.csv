21/10/2022,Boris PÃ©risset,This would be such a time saver because sometimes out of no reason I can't select the current state in the navigation.It would make so much sense. Thanks!
25/03/2020,Terry Minix,Add this. Please!!!
01/02/2019,Allen Matsumoto,Yes this would be helpful lots of times but particularly for troubleshooting what I'm doing now - trying to set a Current class for an in-page nav bar where I can't seem to set the page to a state that the nav bar recognizes as Current.
21/01/2019,Winston Struye,Yes wouldn't this be fairly simple to add as well? Very frusturating
17/08/2018,Alborz Heydaryan,I second this. It gets rather difficult to style the current class. Specially when you're trying to style the current-hover class it shows: current-hover-current and them I'm no longer sure what's happening.
