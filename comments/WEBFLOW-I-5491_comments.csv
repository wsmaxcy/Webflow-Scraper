14/01/2023,MIchael Paasch,Yeah i built my first site in a while - kinda funny tbh that this keeps being overlooked cause there was so many awesome changes since i came back... love the product! there's a workaround for this issue but on more than one occasion the .com/slug/ or /folder-slug/ or /cms-slug/ get all mad at eachother and makes for a difficult ux. keep up the good work.
