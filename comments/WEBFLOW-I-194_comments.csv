22/06/2023,Noah Mitchell,Clients currently have to get in touch with me to manually revert changes. This is making one of them second guess going with Webflow ðŸ«¤
31/05/2023,Kevin Larsen,The editor system should be better arranged for users and regular user errors.
16/05/2023,Studio 34 - Accounts,Absolutely shocking not to have this function. Genuinely appalling...
16/05/2023,Cyrille Berne,I was rather annoyed when I discovered this issue as the ease of editing is one of my key selling points. Now I can't tell Webflow is the perfect solution...
05/05/2023,Ross Forbes,Absolutely mental that this basic feature of "undo" still isn't on Webflow after 6 years of asking for it. No good explanation from my hours of research just excuses like "all CMS' are like this". No they're not. My client feels duped as do I.
12/04/2023,Raivis Sietnieks,What is wrong with the devs? This is awful! Why is this still a problem in 2023?!? What do I do with this unpublished change I do not want! I even manually changed it back and it still persists! Awful. Help!
09/02/2023,Jon Burdon,why has this never been implemented? I was surprised today when training a client and they asked for this basic feature.
27/01/2023,Adrien Lafond,2023 and incredible Webflow still doesnt support..." Undo" ðŸ˜‚
07/11/2022,Emily Miles,Wild to me that this doesn't exist yet! My clients are confused and so am I. As far as I'm concerned the editor is useless without this feature. I also feel like Webflow should be more transparent about this in editor guides; there should be a legitimate warning!
08/10/2022,Carl Labanz,This is such basic functionality that I didn't even look for it until I was showing someone the editor and made a mistake. "Okay we can just undo that..." oh! but little did I know. I was super embarrassed.
22/09/2022,Andi Odermatt,It's 2022 so it's been about 5 years and this feature still isn't available. I just don't understand this. I need to move Clients over from Webflow to WordPress just because of this feature alone and I really do not want to do so. It's a downside to using Webflow if you create a Website for clients this should be a no-brainer. Can someone explain why Webflow might not want to address this or even answer us? Am I missing something? Maybe it's technologically not possible?
29/08/2022,Mandy Hopp,... very confused by this lack of a feature and so are my clients.
15/08/2022,Crystal Lewis,WEBFLOW PLEASE FIX. IT UNDO BUTTON!
07/08/2022,Jack Randall,I agree with Josh below I had a client asking about this today. It does look Webflow look unprofessional.
04/08/2022,Denis Mokin,Omg peaple we need this!
02/08/2022,Josh Attwood,Any update with this? Quite important and makes Webflow look unprofessional to clients!
01/08/2022,Moon Blanc,The faces and comments from custommers that are faced with the fact that ther is no Undo or Discard for changes that they have done and CAN SEE IN THE LIST is making me angry at Webflow... Why making a list when we cannot to anything bout that. Any updates?
28/04/2022,Alexandra MacIsaac,Until this feature is implemented I cannot recommend Webflow to my clients. I am considering leaving altogether.
30/03/2022,Clark AG,This is a feature that should have been added BEFORE Webflow was ever made available for purchase. Not a nice-to-have but a must-have-to-function as many other users have commented.
21/03/2022,Monica SigÃ¼enza,An absolute NEEEEED not a want
