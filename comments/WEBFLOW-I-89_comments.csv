15/03/2022,Monica Sigüenza,Yep I echo others here....the ability to organize in folders or simply to reorder symbols in a way that makes sense would be massively helpful. Now if we're getting fancy a little thumbnail preview (the way figma shows its "componets" which are similar to symbols would be great down the line as well.
07/01/2022,Alex Dixon,This would be super useful when implementing and using design systems.
07/10/2021,Lassi Eronen,Yes - 100% needed. We have about 50 symbols on the list and growing - grouping UI elements and layouts to folders would be absolutely paramount.
02/07/2021,Aaron,Need to sort. Will pay Webflow to prioritize this feature.
02/02/2020,Stuart Walker,Just simply being able to group symbols into folders would help immensely. I would take a leaf out of Sketch's implementation. If you separate your names with a backslash then that creates a subfolder.
06/12/2019,Jim OConnell,I would like drag and drop sorting/arranging.
13/11/2019,Delia Kelley,I'd like this and to take it further: short life free UI to warn about any places that I'm not using the spacings that I set up.
09/03/2018,Evan McDaniel,I'm interested in being able to get info about where each symbol is used across a site.
27/10/2017,Valentin de Bruyn,Agree. In order to create efficient design systems we need a revamped Symbols panel.

07/03/2017,Diarmuid Sexton,I would like the ability to manually re-order the symbols - the same as we can move the interactions up and down to create our own order.
18/01/2017,Timothy Noah,Agree Vincent the old Symbol Panel is sorely missed...
