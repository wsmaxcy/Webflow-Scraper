14/04/2023,Steven McMahan,Support pointed me here and I am surprised to see this request unfulfilled for years. This feature is available with unbouce. I'm not sure why this wouldn't have been resolved by now.
14/02/2023,Sunny Singh,This is a much needed feature. We made the switch from WP/WPforms to Webflow and its the one limitation on the webflow forms.
12/04/2022,Admin Admin,Instapage allows this. It would be great to add this in.
22/02/2021,Al Bsharah,Super bummed this isn't built in. I have a form that can be accessed by any number of links throughout the site. I'd like to know which link was clicked by each person that fills out the form. Can't pass query parameters into a page link.
