28/06/2020,Eric,I agree. I am new to Webflow and have hosting on Godaddy due to working with Muse. I exported the code in my WF site just to test on Godaddy and noticed that there is no sitemap. I am not against hosting on WF but the sites that I have currently hosted on godaddy and built in Muse I would rebuild in WF and host back to godaddy but WF doesn't export the sitemap. This is a limitation to working in WF and kind of sucks since I find WF to be an amazing tool. I pay yearly to build my sites in WF and if I choose to export the code because the client wants to host elsewhere everything should be included or at least charge a price to export a sitemap.
29/05/2020,Alex Dixon,Agreed this would be a useful feature.
