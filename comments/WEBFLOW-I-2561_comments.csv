02/02/2022,R JEFFERY WILSON,Absolutely need more payment integration options. Especially Authorize.net. Have used them you many years and have clients who already have accounts set up. Please please do something about this. Please don't make me have to go back to Drupal or Wordpress. I love Webflow and never what to use any other website builder again. Been on Webflow for almost 4 years with many clients who need this service.
30/11/2021,James Gallagher,Please add Authorize.net to your payment processors. I have two clients who can only use Authorize (conditions stipulated by their banks according to them) and this would make life so much easier.
