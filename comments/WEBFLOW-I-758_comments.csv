15/09/2022,Franky Pixels,This is a no-brainer. So much advertising about how Webflow beats Wordpress‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt beat Wordpress in the range of devices you can use to manage your site. I love Webflow but I need to be able to make hot edits/fixes in transit sometimes. Or at the coffee shop when I only bring my pad‚Ä¶ etc.
31/07/2022,New Moral Perception,Webconf please make it happen üòÄüëç
26/04/2022,Yousif Cheikh,need this!!
25/03/2022,Paulo Moura,I don‚Äôt understand why Webflow still does not support copy>paste on iPad.
24/10/2021,Alessandro Spano,Please add copy and paste on iPad. At least with the magic keyboard.
17/10/2021,Gavi Ravi,Need webfor support for iPad as fast as possibl :)) Even with the Magic Keyboard it would make sense now‚Ä¶
03/07/2021,Alan Kemsley,You can already use Webflow on iPads with a keyboard and mouse you just need to ‚ÄúRequest Desktop Site‚Äù. Although there are a couple of little annoyances (such as having to scroll the sidebar by clicking and draggin the scrollbar). There is only one fuction that I know of that is not available on iPad and that is copying and pasting elements.
23/06/2021,Miklos Obrusanszki,This would be amazing. Lots of little problems but if anyone can do it its the Webflow team. The fact that its desktop safari should mean its atleast in the pipeline for a future update I‚Äôd hope!
15/04/2021,Guillaume Nozon,I‚Äòm crying : copy-paste is impossible on ipad pro. I can‚Äôt believe it...
26/01/2021,Chris Erickson,Kind of no reason for this at all - The new iPad Pro ships with trackpad and keyboard. I understand that Webflow wasn't made for use with touchscreen but the touchscreen doesn't need to be used in Webflow.
14/01/2021,Alex Roman,im thinking of returning my ipad pro becuase i cant use webflow..¬†if apple only made tough screen macbooks.. smh
29/12/2020,Dejan,Being able to design and refine from a park bench? Yes please!!This would truly be amazing
14/09/2020,Renato Po≈ægan,i can design but i can‚Äôt scrools when tabs are open and can‚Äôt change dimensions eather .plz make it compatible we need this feature
26/07/2020,Rob Day,Yes please! This would be a game changer for me - I‚Äôm using my iPad Pro more and more now that I have a trackpad and keyboard. I can edit wordpress websites - but I want to edit my Webflow sites!
09/07/2020,Hector Velez,WebFlow + iPad Pro is a must! It will make the workflow so much better!
27/06/2020,Chris Erickson,I know touch support is a challenge for the Designer but now that iPad Pro has a trackpad and mouse support can this not be resolved somehow?
28/05/2020,Doctr K,Yess pleaseee this would speed up my project by soo many degrees pleasee let us use it on iPad Pro!! There is absolutely no logical reason you guys should hold that back as OP mentions the hardware is capable of handling muchh more than whatever webflow requires Safari supports desktop browsing on iPadOS and webflow with keyboard and trackpad support on the new iOS actually works pretty well so the foundation is already naturally there it just requires a bit of optimization! And with how well webflow is optimized for desktop use already compared to other web design engines you guys can cleanly pull it off on iPadOS I have no doubt.
03/05/2020,Anastasia Naumova,If not full support I would like at least an option to access CMS and add/edit items from iPad mini or mobile phone
25/04/2020,Amai Rawiri,Pleaseeeeeee
17/04/2020,MJ Ambrose,Totally agree. It‚Äôs a big reason I haven‚Äôt really tested Webflow yet  ‚Äì I can do most things on my iPad (including edit to some degree Squarespace and Wix sites but I can‚Äôt do anything with Webflow on my iPad at this point.  It‚Äôs a bummer because it seems like it‚Äôs a great platform.
