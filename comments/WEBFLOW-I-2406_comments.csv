31/03/2021,Web Designer,Yes please! Also please add the "c" keyboard shortcut to open the CMS panel (like "p" for pages "j" for media "a" for components...)
10/06/2020,Sophia Voychehovski,Yes please! For my team specifically we suffer with selecting from a single-reference collection that has about 300 items in it. LOTS OF SCROLLING. Would love type-ahead. Like when you open a dropdown with a list of states and you can type G to jump to Georgia. This is SO painful right now and opens up a big possibility for user error.
