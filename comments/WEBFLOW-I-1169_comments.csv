04/05/2023,Samuel Huwyler,sooo important. please make that possible!
29/04/2023,Nick Ringelmann,bump
31/03/2023,David Bias,Shameful Webflow... I need to provide a package of company logos and other assets to our retail partners. I lobbied hard to move my company's site from Squarespace to Webflow only to find this insane restriction as soon as we go live...
30/03/2023,Arthur Presser,As many commented here it's shocking that this has to be requested in 2023. This is crucial feature for anyone hosting press kits / multi-file brand assets.
02/03/2023,Geraldine Lee,Shocked this still isn't allowed.
01/03/2023,Vladislav Iliushin,It is not possible to upload a simple press kit on the Webflow. How is it something that has to be requested in 2023?
27/01/2023,Nathan Lenkowski,Yet another showstopper issue! My client asked to upload a zip file containing their press kit and we were both shocked to discover its not possible with Webflow. Having to share the file via a Google Drive link looks super unprofessional. Also whats with the 4 MB file upload limit? This feature request should be bumped to the top.
22/12/2022,Kamal Gill,What's the status on this? It boggles my mind how this simple feature is not supported. Further more that someone made the active decision to block most file types in the asset window. Just let us upload whatever we want!
02/12/2022,Thomas Mordasky,My entire project hinges on this simple feature and I only just found out its not supported. It's clear from this thread the need is being ignored.
23/11/2022,Samuel Huwyler,it's time
02/11/2022,BG Admin,Very crucial!
17/10/2022,Matt Woch,Crucial functionality! Please implement.
14/09/2022,Design Team,Please is there an update to this yet?
09/08/2022,Nicole Wendler,Is there any update on this / will it be re-reviewed? Seems to be still an important topic for many people.. :)
06/08/2022,Luca Meusburger,Essential stuff...
27/07/2022,Tim Peterson,I thought about attaching a zip file to my comment but doubt it would work. ;-)
07/06/2022,Bianca Maria Cantelli,I also need the option to add zip-Downloads very badly! Would be happy to have an update from the webflow-team about this.
06/06/2022,Aaron Zide,We would like to have a press kit (zipped file) on our website containing: logos images pdfs etc. Would be really helpful to allow .zip files into the CMS for this. It's been on the radar for 2-3+ years.
20/04/2022,19x17,Agreed. My client has CAD files in .zip that need to be made available. It looks unprofesional to have the links redirect to Dropbox.
