15/06/2023,Rafael De Guglielmo,is just an input JESUS!
28/03/2023,Christopher Allard,It seems as if Webflow has stopped developing their ecommerce. They haven't provided any major updates to eCommerce in two years. It is crazy that one minor feature is the difference between them having a functional product and something that on it's own is useless for the vast majority of users. Having been using Webflow for 9 years now this is pretty dissapointing.

24/06/2021,Leanne Nuttall,Please let this be a feature. It would be  improve customer experience so much!
13/05/2021,Katy O'Hara,Agreed with all the points below this should be prioritised - I was just about to purchase an eCommerce template with you having used Webflow generally for many years.... but I can't believe you don't provide custom input fields on checkouts when personalisation is such a common requirement. Unfortunately you lose me as a long-time customer today :(
