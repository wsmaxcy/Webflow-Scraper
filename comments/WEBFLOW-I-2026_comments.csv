16/01/2023,Michael NÃ¶thiger,This is a must! Please add this feature!
06/12/2022,Daan,What? Editors don't have access to the asset manager?? That's quite shitty. Please please work this out.
19/09/2022,William Barton,Seriously? This seems so basic WordPress got you beat here Webflow. SMH
06/09/2022,Frankie Gonzalez,Can you please prioritize this? The fact that this feature is missing is mind boggling. I have clients who need to upload PDFs from the rich text editor and they are not able to. Workarounds for this (creating a separate collection for assets having them click the link copying the URL and then pasting it back in the collection item they were originally working in) is extremely inefficient especially for resource-rich websites. This makes Webflow not seem like a strong CMS option for so many projects.
13/06/2022,Rene,I work with collections and my clients can create entries but once they want to add a PDF it doesn't work. This is functionalities that you figure out you need at the end of a project but then you decided already for webflow and you are screwed. Of course the backend of Wordpress allows that.
07/03/2022,Robin Spoerl,Just discovered that my editors don't have access to the asset manager when one of them accidentally changed an image and then couldn't change it back. I am very suprised this funtionality isn't included.
09/02/2022,Ollie Law,I see this still hasn't been actioned. It's quite remarkable my clients can't access the library of assets (images files etc) from the Editor and instead is required to upload every time - was a bit embarissing explaining this lack of functionality when it's available on most CMS like Wordpress and even Wix (ew).
01/06/2021,Anna Bohn,My client needs to be able to upload new a pitch deck PDF every so oftenâ€”it would be great if they could do this through the editor.
21/01/2021,Judii Tran,Please! This would be so great. Especially because they can make changes to the Page settings (SEO titles meta OpenGraph etc.). It would be great for them to be able to select from the existing content in the Asset Manager when they want to swap OpenGraph pics. Sometimes clients may rotate content or swap images and not know how to optimize files for web so they will just upload their own larger version of existing assets that meet their needs. This can help resolve that problem.
17/05/2019,JosÃ© Ernesto RodrÃ­guez,ðŸ’¯ â€” currently I have toÂ host my vCard on Dropbox because I canâ€™t upload it as an asset.
