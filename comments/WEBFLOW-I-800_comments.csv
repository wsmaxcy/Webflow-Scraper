03/03/2020,Bertrand Perrin,This has to be made! And it shouldn't be too complicated to implement and so helpful!
29/06/2019,Noah Raskin,MUCH NEEDED!!! Especially in interactions you always have to choose a text color for example on the hover out state instead of being able to set the color back to "inherit" the parent elements text color which it was to begin with.
