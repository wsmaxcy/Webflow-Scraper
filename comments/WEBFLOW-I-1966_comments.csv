16/04/2019,Hamish Maclean,This is a cool idea. I was thinking Webflow should directly integrate with airtable. But this has better scope. I could build a database in FileMaker or anything and have webflow access the required data. It would be nice to have more zapier power within Webflow itself that is for sure.
