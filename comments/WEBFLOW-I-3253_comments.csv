16/06/2023,John Asare,it has been 3 years waiting for this feature to be built.
16/05/2023,Suzan Szollar,Agree with comments below I'm about to launch my first product which comes in 9 sizes. Pre-orders minimize waste because instead of guessing the quantity of sizes to manufacture production can match exactly what's been ordered.
08/11/2022,Jonatan Hinnenthal,This needs to be available! Just a checkout with the option to let the owner know you are interested in those products.
28/07/2022,Latitude 50,Ahhhh... The frustration when you discover this is not possible.
09/04/2022,Vytenis Burneikis,It is a must. Preorder feature would be perfect.
05/09/2021,Giomero Brand,This is important
03/09/2021,Wai Phyo,+ 3 from me. This is a must have for an e-commerce website. What are you waiting webflow?
09/04/2021,Jamie Thomas,+3 from me. I'm a new shop owner managing the production of my first line of products would be much easier if I was able to pre order.
01/01/2021,Sean Young,Now that I properly understand how the votes work I've officially transferred over 3 of my votes for this feature!
01/01/2021,Sean Young,Definitely trying to vote on this Highly requested! Not sure why I don't have any votes left lol.
30/10/2020,Alex,+1
16/10/2020,Behzad Pournaghi,Defenitly YES can I vote 10 times for this? This is very helpful for artist to crowdfund for their albums or any other upcoming products.
09/10/2020,Lindsey,YES THIS IS SO CRUCIAL to new store owners I really don't want to rebuild in Shopify just for this feature
15/09/2020,Eavan English,Yes this is really necessary to have on an ecommerce site
