15/06/2023,Rafael De Guglielmo,is just a check box at checkout!!!! and an email template for instructions.

18/11/2022,Iskren Kralev,I still can not believe there is not such feature. In my country most online shoppers usually pay on delivery so that is one of the reasons  I will not use Webflow. I hope something changes in near future!
31/07/2022,Jacob Philp,Absolutely essential.  Over three years ago this was requested now with 318 votes.  C'mon Webflow - this is just a radio button "How you do want to pay?" -> Credit Card/Debit Card or Direct Deposit (COD) with a custom email template for the latter which provides payment instructions to the customer.
09/06/2022,Michal DovrtÄ›l,Withou this the ecommerce is unusable
20/05/2022,Tine Maher,Loosing clients on behalf of limited payment options is a bummer .... Did a workaround for the Cash On Delivery using promo code but not really great sollution .... Cause every customer gets an email with set discount which confuses them. ... Also the Client isn't really satisfied with the limited options he doesn't want to accept card payments only paypal and cash on delivery + SEPA Bank Transfer ...
13/04/2022,Tim,Not only developing countries. Here in Switzerland I need the option so my client can send his client's orders with an invoice.
29/11/2021,Pisarna Emazing,Well.. in eastern europe the most popular option is cash on delivery
30/06/2021,Robin Klaiss,Pleaseeeeeeee!!!
18/05/2021,Kanoa Lindiwe,please make this possible Webflow!
05/05/2021,Andy,Please!
14/04/2021,Botond Bogyay,Due to the lack of this feature I haven't switched from Wordpress / Shopify / etc yet.
15/03/2021,Jacob Lee,When's it available ?
22/12/2020,Printing.com Whangarei,Yes please
12/12/2020,Eduard Mihaila,please give us at least a temporary solution for now. i have big problems with my clients. *freelancer RO
10/11/2020,Shakthi Palraj,i'm pretty surprised by the fact that there isn't a cash on delivery option available on Webflow. Countries like Pakistan and India have MASSIVE populations and are growing exponentially with ecommerce and about 99% pf the market functions through cash on delivery/payment on receiving. You're essentially ignoring hundreds of thousands of people that might be looking to use your platform. Considering the flexibility you guys provide it's honestly disappointing this hasn't been looked at in over a year and a half?!I was honestly in love with the platform. The webflow tutorials are perfect and the design tools powerful yet simple to understand.It's a real shame you're missing out on the opportunity for thousands of subscribers to your service due to one simple yet vital checkout option. I guess Shopify/Woocommerce (God. It'll be a pain to go back once you've tasted a good website builder) it is then?
30/07/2020,Charlie Williams,This would be amazing chaps. Have a food delivery client where he wants clients to order online but some want to place the order and pay cash on delivery of the food...

09/07/2020,Amine Benatti,What's wrong with you guys we've been asking for this feature for so looong it's a must!!! we wanna use Webflow for what it provides in terms of design and flexibility but we can't without a cash on delivery system i guess we'll just stick with woocommerce
09/07/2020,Marjan Korez,Yes!
