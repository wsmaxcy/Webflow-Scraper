18/02/2023,Christos Savvides,is this out there yet? would love to have this :(
11/02/2023,Gaetan EKSZTEROWICZ,guys It's been 2 year. What are you doing actually??? Are you using your own product I have serious doubts now. WTF are you seriously doing we've all lost hours with your rubbish way to deal with other scale edit. Should be more than time to make it happen.
06/09/2022,Startup Booster,This needs to happen.
20/07/2022,Jessica Lawshe,This would save me so much time! I literally end up starting over with new classes such a waste of time.
09/06/2022,Edwon Edwon,please dear god please
20/04/2022,Tiago Pereira,Please!
17/03/2022,Josh Coleman,This is my one major gripe about using webflow and it is a big one. You cannot remove a breakpoint that you've added or it's settings in one go. The preview window changes the breakpoint in design view which as someone else has pointed out leads to hours of wasted work before you notice you're editing the wrong breakpoint. Upsetting to see there's still no progress on this major problem.
29/10/2021,Johan Wettergren,I really wish I had this right now.
23/09/2021,Sprints Digital,Breakpoints are a massive pain at the moment.
22/09/2021,Charlie McMahon,Really need this. This is my biggest frustration with Webflow.
08/06/2021,Owen Carstensen,Amen! This is my biggest frustration with webflow...
23/05/2021,Tommy Paul,For me the problem happens when I preview different breakpoints and don't notice the current breakpoint is now changed when I toggle back to the developer! Then I may be programming a couple hours before I notice the mistake.  Preview should NOT reset the developer breakpoint! They are not the same thing and combining their breakpoint changes creates the problem.  When it does happen secondly I'd love to be able to completely clear the breakpoint I mistakenly programmed in; but instead I have to spend time making the main breakpoint match.  (And will later have to update the mistake breakpoint to again match the main one instead of updates passing down to it.
18/05/2021,Nino,PLEASE i really need these. Breakpoints are such a mess at the moment
01/04/2021,Rafikah Halim,YES PLEASE
07/03/2021,Andrej Hribernik,Absolutely need this ASAP
17/02/2021,Yulee Li,Yes I need it for a bigger breakpoint. Because my browser somehow adapts to a bigger breakpoint instead of a standard one
04/11/2020,Ze Rusty,Need this asap!
14/10/2020,Adam,YES to this!!!!
