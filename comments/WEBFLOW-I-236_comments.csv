30/12/2021,Buckley Robert,The form element inserts a component designed to contain controls that users can interact with to send information back to the server. This element is commonly used to gather information from the visitors of a website like preferences comments opinions and a lot more.
02/07/2019,BitBranding,We just needed to make some changes to checkbox for one of our projects. This will be an excellent addition!
11/11/2018,Jason Dark,+100 for thisAt the moment I am using 3rd party CSS libraries but if Webflow could allow us to design these components it would be a game changer.
08/05/2018,Mark Godwin,This is a constant desire of mine. It would be good to have a complete overhaul of forms to enable us to have multiple steps and complete control over all field styling.
30/04/2018,Simon Lucas,Please update Webflow to support this! I think it is a really crucial feature. I should not have to rely on hacks to build an app that has custom dropdowns!
04/04/2018,Kyle Kettler,This is such a crucial feature for the web today. I can't believe it still doesn't even seem to be on the development team's radar.
08/03/2018,Jarrett,I would love to be able to create styled "radio" buttons similar to the attachment below.
24/08/2017,Jonathan Abdon,Yes totally backing this. I believe this is very crucial. Many would switch to other frameworks because of the absence of such features
14/02/2017,Vako Shvili,Totally backing this feature. Inability to style form elements fullyÂ is quite a bummer. Even drag-n-drop site and landing page builders like Wix and Instapage allow this.
24/01/2017,Squlion Admin,I cannot request this feature enough. Forms are such a huge part of web and application design. The attached screenshot is from our current project and as you can see the capability to style these elements would be a great addition to Webflow. Gave this one a vote!
