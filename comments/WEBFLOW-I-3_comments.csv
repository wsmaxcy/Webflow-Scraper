22/06/2023,Luova toimisto Muka,Come on! xD It wouldnÂ´t take long time.
10/06/2023,Witthaya Chomchoei,it should be a very besic in this application?
05/06/2023,Simon Rose,Come ON
24/05/2023,Nadia Ben Halima,It's a real bummer not being able to select multiple elements (at least elements in the same div or the same type element)
24/05/2023,Esben Engsted,Would speed of onces workflow a lot on big/long pages!
18/05/2023,Adriano Resende,This wish was created in 2017 and now in 2023 with a big developer team this doesn't is implemented yet.
13/05/2023,Schuyler,I'm sorry but W. T. F.
12/05/2023,Fabrizzio Andrioli,up
28/04/2023,Fara Alexander,Much needed
20/04/2023,Brian Smith,This is LITERALLY one of the top reasons websites exist... to collect emails with selection preferences. Why on earth isn't this native??? I've used Webflow for a long time and this one boggles the mind. Please get it done Webflow team. No shift no extra steps... just dropdown click the options - see them added with little X's so they can also be removed. ~ Otherwise thanks for creating a great platform.
08/04/2023,Sindre Skoglund-Hansen,Yess please just let me hold shift and select multiple elements
27/03/2023,Odama Studio,somehow until now this feature has not been realized with the wrap in div/link shortcut update this will be very useful in grouping elements
26/03/2023,Kim,Please. I don't wanna move 40 things from one container to the other manually anymore.
23/03/2023,Ivan Sunguroff,Please. God. Why? WHY??!?!?!?
23/03/2023,Joe Eitzen,HOW HAS THIS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED? Posted 5 years ago a basic quality-of-life feature is no where to be seen.
15/03/2023,Jan Henrik Hansen,Agreed. Trying to copy multiple elements between pages is a real pain. Lots of going back and forth. Since you can't have the Designer open in multiple Tabs this limitation is even more annoying.
09/03/2023,Andrew,This seems like a pretty important and necessary feature.
24/02/2023,Peter Gerdes,Ummm... Seriously Webflow? You are king and you don't have range select in assets?
07/02/2023,Gabriella Magamas,how has this not been added yet. This would be incredibly useful
23/01/2023,Marcos Arias,this feature not being on webflow feels kind of ridiculous at this point. this would be amazing pleasee
