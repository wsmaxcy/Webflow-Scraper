12/04/2020,Skyler Kline,After giving this a bit more thought I think the actual section headers in the style pallettes should change and be color coded per breakpoint. I'm thinking shades of one color in the smaller direction and shades of another color in the larger direction. Of course the buttons at the top should be matching colors. I mute button would be nice too for times you don't want the extra color distracting from the designâ€”but maybe still something like flipping the dark to light so you know what breakpoint you're in.
