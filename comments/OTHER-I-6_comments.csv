11/10/2022,Ezra Siton,-1. In my opinion this idea not related to Webflow (Use any third party tool out there free or paid).
16/06/2020,Thibaut Tiberghien,or cheaper: https://www.crazyegg.com/
16/06/2020,Thibaut Tiberghien,Found an alternative to Google Optimize: https://university.webflow.com/integrations/optimizely
16/06/2020,Thibaut Tiberghien,Definitely needed or at least suggest integrations other than Google Optimize. Not everyone wants Google analytics on their site!
12/03/2020,Paul Seymour,Yeah... I nievely had +3 votes for this then I read https://university.webflow.com/article/integrate-google-optimize
09/02/2020,Vincent Redor,What is a great web design without testing its performance using Split Testing?
15/01/2020,Joel Goodman,Fantastic. Pro tools like this are what Webflow needs.
09/06/2019,Shaun Lonergan,This is so needed
26/05/2019,Ezra Siton,google optimize
10/11/2018,Michiel Rauws,In under 15 minutes I got my first A/B test running! :DGoogle Optimize is free as opposed to very $$ alternatives like Optimizely.
23/10/2018,Charlie Dolan,This would be great to have. I don't want to have to integrate another service just to feed up different HTML - would love webflow to have a 'collection' of content sections that I could return and track the usage of.
02/06/2018,Craig Connell,100% for split testing. Especially with eCommerce looming.
07/05/2018,Etienne Delorme,At first it can be a simple feature like Intercom does to test the content (messages images...).
14/04/2018,Gonsalves Media,I personally don't think Webflow should be focusing resources on this. There are plenty of great A/B tools out there as Dominic Romito commented.
08/01/2018,Guido Jansen,I agree with Dominic Romito: Just use an A/B testing tool to do this. I wouldn't want the webflow team spending their resources on building a completely new feature that can easily be integrated for free.
24/12/2017,Dominic Romito,I think this is a neat idea but isn't that what Google Optimize and Optimizely are for?
05/07/2017,Ahmed Murray,This needs to move up fast
14/06/2017,Nathan Steele,If Webflow is going to be full fledged all in one web design tool and CMS...then having a A/B Testing is essential especially if you want it to be the go to by agencies instead of Wordpress.
11/05/2017,Scott Van Zandt,This would be awesome and will become more and more important as marketing evolves and becomes more a part of what we as web designers & developers do.
