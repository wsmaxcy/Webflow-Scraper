03/05/2023,Felix,This becomes apparent in the middle of a project. Actually a bummer
17/02/2023,Tin GRAINCA,Please change this limit
23/12/2022,Kwame B,This is honestly essential. Even if it has to be limited to paid plans.
05/11/2022,Cosmo Scharf,Dear Webflow team I would be willing to pay extra to have more CMS reference fields. Having only five seriously limits what I can do with my website and is extremely frustrating. I urgently request you to consider making this change. This was posted five years ago. What is the status of increasing this limit?
26/07/2022,Linus Horemans,Was at a meeting with big client too bad this 5 limitation made us chose alternative option. Please fix this your losing customers.
18/06/2022,Mnngful Publishing,The limit make many users to think about moving from webflow. My projects and customer's project don't work with such limit. 10 is the minimum
11/04/2022,Maria Silva,Please change this limit
19/03/2022,Imane Kaddo,Please change this and up the limit to 8-10. This is a very necessary feature and is putting me off from using Webflow all together.
25/02/2022,Alex Robinson,Why have the reduced this? It's totally ruined my whole business model!! Nightmare .... Can someone from Webflow please respond to this so we can know whether to leave the platform or not?
19/02/2022,Jon marius Nilsson,Can we just get a possibility to pay for more multi reference fields.... Customers have no problem paying for it so why make this limitation that basicly makes webflow useless for some cases? I just need 20 of them to make a very dynamic menu system for a restaurant with multiple locations. But for now I can only get 10 no matter what?
31/01/2022,Sean,I thought something was wrong when I went to add a 6th ref field. For e-commerce how would one build out a catalog with just 5 reference fields? (Commerce Plan)
05/01/2022,Doable,Paying customer here. I was about to upgrade but now I'm about to leave completely.
12/12/2021,Vikram,Please increase the number of multi-reference fields that one can use per CMS collection... this will be very useful in the project I am working on.
07/12/2021,Jonathan,Stuck on a project without the ability to have more than 5 multi-reference fields. Please unlock this capability for users.
01/12/2021,Austin Skillings,I'm in dire need of this as well. I have no idea what I'm going to do to accomplish some of my clients needs. One reason I cannot switch completely over to Webflow from Wordpress etc. Having only 5 reference's is a pretty sad number to be honest :(. PLEASE remove limitation.
11/10/2021,Red Ben,I am a paying customer as all other people that have commented and upvoted. Webflow it's your responsability to respond to your paying customer's requests. Remove the limitation!
30/09/2021,Jason Roach,Please adjust this limitation. 5 is just too low--please consider at least 8-10.
23/09/2021,Ian Watts,This is a feature I would be willing to pay more money for. It should at least be available as an option on some premium plans or as an optional upgrade. I would love to use Webflow for all my creation needs but given the complexity of the systems I am trying to design I am not sure I will be able to use Webflow. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TAKE MY MONEY
16/09/2021,Guillaume Langlois,I wonder why Webflow would limit the potential of its users in such a way. The 5 limit and the impossibility to nest more than one collection per page is incapacitating.
26/08/2021,Ranjit Sreenivas,Yes please!
