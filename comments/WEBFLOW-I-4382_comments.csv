26/01/2023,Oskar Kjos,This will be so helpfull and cant be that hard to add! Love the idea
30/07/2021,Paulina Tsui,Yes! Sites have so many decorative images and icons. At some point I might have to go back and resize everything or reupload for optimization and that will be a pain. Plus the click surface for the cog to open the settings is so small it makes it extra tedious to do it for so many.
