29/03/2023,Christopher Allard,Has anyone over the last four years found another solution for this seeing as Webflow refuses to address the problem?
02/02/2023,Avenir Dessin,Any news about this？
20/01/2023,Tom,Browsing our customisable products really helps promote our manufacturing services but it’s very rare that someone would buy one off-the-shelf without obtaining a quote first (to the point that we want to exclude that functionality).
14/12/2022,David Ditzler,This is over 85% of our business because of the custom work we do.
16/06/2022,AdExperts,Oh please Webflow! It's been almost 4 YEARS since this request was made and still  don't have any answer from you.   :'( We need this option ASAP please!!!
05/01/2022,Kate Hoffer,Any updates on this?
20/09/2021,Grant Senior,We have this need now as well. Client wants users to be able to request a quote before purchasing.
30/06/2021,Nicole Mauriello,Yes I need this also as items I sell are highly customized. Currently I have built this 'functionality' as a simple form that asks visitor some questions.
05/08/2020,Ruth Wright-Palmer,Is there any update on this?
08/05/2020,Harshman Sukhlecha,need !
07/05/2020,Nicole Mauriello,Yes this is something I also need.  I have a mix of items. Some have a specific cost and work well with e-commerce as is setup now in Webflow. But others will require a quote because they are customized.
19/04/2020,Devhaus,This is a must have for sure
12/04/2020,Erich Vogt,I would also really appreciate this function!!
23/03/2020,Cameron Gomersall,Amen! Webflow where are you? We need this ASAP. I'm assuming this would be an easy addition the framework. I mean you could just allow us to delete the payment section from the checkout page builder.
15/01/2020,John Smith,I need this for a project now. Will have to look at Woo Commerce I think. Euuugh WordPress :(
31/10/2019,Daniel Nicholls,I desperately need this but with the option to display prices and total cost of order/s with discounts and mark ups/downs specific to the customer.
01/08/2019,Manuela Bonetti,I need this asap! Is this option in planning and if so when can I work with it?
07/06/2019,Gerardo Morales,I really need this!
01/05/2019,Olzhas Beisenbayev,Need that asap. My current setup of collections + pages + contact options for custom quote inquiry is hard to maintain. Webflow Ecommerce without the actual checkout would perfectly fit my needs.Webflow team please do it.
20/02/2019,Kevin Holland,This would be excellent for the Graphic Design services portion of my business. I can see this possibly extending into a Creative Brief form so the client is seeing an estimate directly related to form inputs. Which this I could transform onboarding in a way that'd allow me to run advertisements directly to that page.
