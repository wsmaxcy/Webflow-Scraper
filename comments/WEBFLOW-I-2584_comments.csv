19/04/2022,Virgile Donadieu,Hey Jordan ! You can do this with Abyssale's dynamic image feature. Basically you can generate images by adding parameters to an url like so : https://linktomyimage?product-name="ProductName"Using the custom code feature of Webflow you can then add the specific meta tags for each social media. Then add the link to your dynamic image to each og:image tag and insert your dynalic CMS data in every spot like you see in the images attached.We are personnally doing it to auto-generate the OG images of our blog tags and it works wonders :)
