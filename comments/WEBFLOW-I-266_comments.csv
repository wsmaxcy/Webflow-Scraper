30/01/2023,Tom Binroth,It is 2023 and there is still no progress. Will it ever be implemented??? A official statement would be helpful.
20/10/2022,Matanuy Wild,5 years. still not here? why? this looks like a basic function that should be there from early days.
01/06/2022,Elisey Martynov,Totally agreed.
08/12/2021,Yung,Hello people from the pastI agree.
19/07/2021,Tom Binroth,Yes I am spending way too much time on comparing and rearraning css classes. Hopeing for a implementation soon.
02/07/2021,Simon Pheasey,Totally agree the Webflow way of organising classes is super annoying. There should also be a way of naming parent elements and then targetting all elements underneath said parent (naming a <ul> with a class then style ul.className > li  for example). Having to name EVERY element for styling is rather tedious. You should also be able to export SASS as well as re-organise the classes in the style manager and have them EXPORT in that order too. I would love to use Webflow as a pure design tool i.e. build the site in Webflow but export out for other projects currently this is very cumbersome. Webflow as a full ecosystem is not right for every project but the in built designer is largely fantastic would be nice to iron out some things so it can be used just for the front end design and build.
27/03/2021,Jessica chos,Please add this feature :( Editing and re-eorganizing classes currently is super destructive and annoying.
11/12/2019,David,Dear Webflow Team is there any chance that you will add this feature?
13/06/2019,Johnny Garces,YES
16/02/2019,Josh Williams,Bumping this one for all the nit-picky folks out there. This would be a fabulous addition for those who aim to keep the output organized and clean.
17/08/2018,Marisa Falcigno,Please add this! Our css file export is horribly messy to work with.
27/04/2018,Andy Neale,I'm commenting here in the hope that it gets more votes. I am perplexed this is not more popular.
19/04/2018,Johnny Garces,have to agree with this one- hope this gets implemented
