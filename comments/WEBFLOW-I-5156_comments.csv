27/06/2022,Sam,Side note - imagine using this with custom option fields for e-commerce items much like how the CMS allows for custom fields. This would alleviate a lot of problems for vendors who sell bespoke items that may need different prices per material/height etc... Or if you're a digital seller who wants to charge more for customers using their goods in public  under a commercial license (instead of a personal one)... just some more thoughts!
