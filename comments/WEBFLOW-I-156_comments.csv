04/03/2022,John Robert,It is a skeptical question that creates a debate among Wikipedia contributors and followers. Wikipedia is free of cost and an open digital encyclopedia that allows Wikipedia research experts to participate and contribute to Wikipedia articles. It enables contributors to add their voluntary expertise and they receive nothing in return. Wikipedia officially denies and prohibits the idea of paid editing. The company supports and stands firmly on its viewpoint opinion to not pay any money to the editors and contributors on their services. The editors get paid by the third party and are not directly paid by the Wikipedia platform.
11/09/2020,Ashley Ridley,I completely agree with the answer by Kendra. Actually I'm a writer and used to write technical content. I'm doing this stuff from the last 5 years. I was wandering to saw the answer to this question and Kendra really wrote a good reply. I want to make myself to write content in every field and recently I have written an article Free Download Android Games for Kids under Age 10 and it will give you an idea of my skills. If anyone is reading my answer then please rate my writings. Thanks

06/02/2020,Kendra Zemlak,Creating duplicate significantly reduces the quality of your developed dynamic list therefore it is my suggestion for other professionals not to do it. Here I got Topics Mill for selecting topic for my essay writing tasks about technology. If an individual is interested in getting high quality content he should not do it.
19/01/2017,Jaro Quastenberg,thanks! i already know that. but this increases the number of dynamic lists on your site (limit is 20 right now) and also decreases performance as the content has to load two times.
19/01/2017,Diarmuid Sexton,A simple work around is to duplicate your dynamic list and turn the duplicate on/off for the different breakpoints.
