25/10/2022,Carl Hagbjörk,Not being able to import &nbsp; in text phone rich-text collection fields is extremeley annoying.I tried to follow google's style guides for telephone number formats which says to use non-breaking-spaces but Webflow won't allow me to import our 1500 phone numbers that way. It sucks.
19/10/2022,Will Richman,Please allow import of site to webflow!
18/05/2022,Nathan Weber,This is the reason I followed the ad. The ability to visualize my code through your system has a pull for me. I thought that would set it apart from other editors. This just looks like another editor to me.
21/01/2022,Michael Urwin,"everyone coding their HTML/CSS differently" shouldnt have anything to do with importing it.
16/01/2022,Henrik Vendelbo,I'm puzzled by this conclusion. Why can't you import static pages? I have two profile pages that I need to bring over. I've put a full working week into them in the past. Why do I have to redo that work?
15/10/2020,Robin Fisher,I have been a hand-coder for over 20 years and love the potential for your platform. I would love to have a robust alternative to WordPress which is heavy and buggy and insecure.
15/10/2020,Team Kalibra,This will be gold for folks who are migrating. Killer feature! Go for it Webflow team! Listen to the people :P
04/10/2020,Skyler Reeves,This is the primary reason why I'm continuing to use WordPress and considering Duda since it seems to do everything Webflow does but also allows me to access to the code.
13/07/2020,Rob MacLean,This would be a great feature especially to get up and running for an existing site.
04/07/2020,Luca G. Soave,+1 - Absolutely add this.
23/06/2020,Walker Harman,Please add this feature. It would give developers a lot more flexability.
10/05/2020,Nicolas duclos,would be easier for people who already coded a part of their website.
15/02/2020,Sean Mcclure,If this is truly too difficult for webflow to implement we can help. This feature should be in webflow. It's silly for it not to be
21/01/2020,Milosz Herman,that is a missing feature. I mean importing custom HTML. Other platforms allow to do this. I think it should not be very diffiucult. Designers just should be aware that the HTML/CSS must be prepared according to standards. To sum it up. It is the only feature that lowers the commercial value of webflow significantly.
02/01/2020,Bryan Falla,Then at least let us manipulate it. It's so limiting not being able to isolate elements.
16/06/2019,Michael Frysztacki,Voting awesome feature request.
02/03/2019,Max Pauwels,Honnestly I was very excited when I first discovered Webflow but I think that they took the wrong approach as it is really only directed towards designers.
04/01/2019,Tyler Kemp,Even if this could get a project CLOSE to the original it'd still be a great feature.
02/11/2018,Julian Ranny,This would be next level for webflow and understandably very tough. To get started it would be great to have a possible guideline for web developers to be able to code by so designers on webflow and developers will be able to co-exist through webflow.
09/04/2018,David Dove,This would be a great idea
