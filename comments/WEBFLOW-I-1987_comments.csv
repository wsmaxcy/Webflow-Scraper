23/08/2019,Alexander Zaxarov,Hi I have the same problem. I'd like to build our new website on Webflow and I need to transfer almost 1000 projects to Webflow CMS. My current post's URL is structured this way: www.example.com/project-name and as I see there is no way to make it the same way in Webflow. Do you have any plans to fix it?
