11/05/2023,Chandler Hartigan,This would be an extremely useful feature. My example is that we have two sites: one being a production site that will be live once finished the other where we built out the style guide and all the sections that our live site will use like a development site. Once we finished our style guide and sections development site we started pasting the finished sections into the production site but classes start getting duplicated and we end up with for example text-color-primary text-color-primary 2 backgorund-color-primary background-color-primary 2 and so on.
24/06/2022,Kevin Handy,This has to be considered again.  It's enough of a hassle that I can't even really use Webflow made templated to start from.  Example: The Basic Webflow Ecommerce template.  It's a great place to jump off from when building out some of the Ecom pages.  Like the products page.
11/06/2021,ORyan McEntire,Agreed.It would be great if when pasting Webflow would ask if I wanted to rename conflicting styles or ignore those conflicting styles and only add new ones.
