15/09/2020,Tony Ennis,For anyone who needs this urgently please email me at ennis.tony@gmail.com. Fired up a proxy app for a customer this morning to remove the API limits (load tested up to 3000 requests per second) - if this is something people will pay for I'll open it up.

26/05/2020,Eric Unger,Yes please! This is especially important with Ecommerce being so limited so if you're using Integromat or similar automation service you hit the limit quickly. I would even pay $ monthly for access to a "premium" API. >300 per minute would be ideal.
28/11/2017,James Vreeken,We are running into the same issue.  the rate limit is very low.  Right now we have 167 cms articles and without the ability to filter on collection items we have to first get all the items with pagination of 100 per request and then iterate over the 167 items to find the ones we want to modify.  So there is a lot of custom coding around the collection pagination and rate limits which are pretty low.  We can make what we need to work but even doubling these limits would help immensely.  If the rate limits were doubled it would solve a lot of problems for many developers who otherwise wouldn't be able to work with the API at all because of the low limits.Suggestions:Double the rate limit from 60/minute to 120/minute and the collection to return 200 per page instead of 100 as the maximum items to return. Also allow the ability to filter a collection request by a field so that I could query the collection for items that are published draft archive etc... or by a custom specified field.
