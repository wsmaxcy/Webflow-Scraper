22/02/2023,Garret Voorhees,Any updates on this? We really need the ability to password protect individual collection items.
03/05/2021,Nicholas Quinn,This would definitely help with both user data management permissions and the fact that we spend $300 a year for memberstack.io ;(
18/12/2019,Martijn Hoppenbrouwer,Yes this is how passwords and CMS items should work. I'm curious there isn't much going on here? Is there any news on this?
26/03/2019,Koen Spaansen,This is what i need.. now i make a collection of 40 items then i make 40 pages with a password... this would save me tons of time!
