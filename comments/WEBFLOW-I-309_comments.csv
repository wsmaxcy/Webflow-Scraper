15/06/2023,Tilmann Roth,@Webflow team - what is wrong with you? after 5 years you still haven't resolved this. why. WHY!!
22/04/2023,Maciej G√≥rski,even
21/02/2023,Kate McMahon,2023 and still not possible....
12/09/2022,Michael Wells,I'm working on a solution for this to post-process some simple markup into a nested list. I need some folks to help me test and validate my use cases. Anyone keen to help test can message me - mike@sygnal.com. Demo is here-https://nested-lists-richtext.webflow.io/demo-2
18/08/2022,Tomasz ≈Åuczak,@webflow since it got reviewed in 2017 is it not going to be looked upon again?
10/08/2022,Georgia Rust,üôà
12/07/2022,Romi Sadlik,This is the kind of thing that leads me to say that Webflow is the worst website builder around.  I would never recommend it to a client.  I would advise them to avoid Webflow at all costs.  Missing elementary functionality and not in any way intuitive.  Worst UI ever.
12/07/2022,Paul Seymour,"It's 2022! Let's implement this 'feature' that is available since the beginning of the internet.." Agreed! üòÜ But really... if you can't support this give me a break. And also agree with Alex... it is hello embarrassing.
08/07/2022,Mahn Arc,Y no nest in 2022??????
10/06/2022,Kyle Adams,I'm really surprised this isn't a thing already and hasn't been for at least 5 years. üò¨
06/05/2022,Maarten Mieras,It's 2022! Let's implement this 'feature' that is available since the beginning of the internet..
14/04/2022,Alex Dixon,It's pretty embarrassing having to tell a client that they can't do this on Webflow üò¨
08/02/2022,Marc Baskin,Astounded this still hasn't been done ... 5 years later?! Its not like Webflow is cheap or anything and this is a basic feature of even the cheapest ancient CMS tools. just wow.
04/02/2022,Zac Toler,Possible work around; using "em" in lists to create the nested items
20/01/2022,Jeremiah Smith,Really? Still not possible? This is suuuuuuper basic and very unfortunate it's not possible in WF.
06/01/2022,Pete Blatchford,Who's up for coming back on the 31st to celebrate the 5th birthday of this one?
07/12/2021,Dan,4 years have past. Still missinging the "increase indent" functionality that is basic to every other web editor on the market (including this comments RTE).
26/11/2021,Pete Blatchford,Why
17/11/2021,Zhong Hui Tee,can't even do nested list inside cms with rich text field. :(
17/11/2021,Zhong Hui Tee,this function is important~ Need this especially for content such as Privacy.
