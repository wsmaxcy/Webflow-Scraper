20/01/2020,Paul Seymour,I'd settle for some kind of standard math or range format just as an input anywhere... such as say timings for interactions. rnd(500 2000) for the fade up on a class of thumbnails would be awesome for example - each thumbnail fades in between half a second and 2 seconds. so simple. I know zero javascript and who knows what lies behind IX2 but after an hour or so off googling I'm no where near having a clue how to do something that the above line for timing could do for me. Oh well. I'm out of votes too. 1 vote? #sadface
