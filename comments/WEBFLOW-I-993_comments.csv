28/07/2022,Joel Downs,Agreed on this.  Perhaps give us an option for how aggressive we want our image compression to be?  I can see artists wanting their portfolio sites to be at high quality but for my sites I'm all about the page performance and your compression is seriously lacking in that regard.  Like the original poster I end up having to download all my images compress them and re-upload just to get reasonable file sizes.
18/02/2022,Guest,You can now lazy load images better than Webflow and convert into WebP or AVIF Format for both image and background images: https://stacket.app/
03/11/2020,Tim Jones,All images should be compressed on upload there is virtually no SaaS web design service that does this properly. Be the first.
12/06/2018,Dahlia Orcajada,Yes please!
15/11/2017,Hannu Virta,Standard WebFlow sites should pass all Google quality tests by default.
15/11/2017,Hannu Virta,Yes this is very important.!
