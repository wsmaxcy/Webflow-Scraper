03/05/2022,Austin Skillings,Completely agree. I wonder why there is not more votes for this. I understand people are designers but as a marketer this is a necessity. I have to take all my descriptions and title tags and paste into a google sheets with a formula to tell my character count. It would be SO convenient if it just did that in Webflow. It already shows a suggestion but adding a character count would be so much more useful.
