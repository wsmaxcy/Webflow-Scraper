27/09/2021,Winston Struye,I agree with this and quite frankly it doesn't seem like it would be too difficult?
22/09/2021,NFDEVELOPMENT,Yes this is much needed for client proposals!
04/08/2021,William Ilarraza,I was looking for this now. I need a method to password protect pages in a CMS collection but type. I have collection lists for the types but I'm unsure of a way to assign the protection.
25/06/2021,Jason Roach,The ability to password protect individual CMS pages is important but not just a global password that can be used for all items within that collection but allowing for a unique password per item.One example use case: Proposal CMS with a unique proposal for each client and therefore a unique password for each proposal such that someone cannot access someone else's proposal.For example see attached mock-up where we could define as a field type although there may be better UX for defining this per item.
