02/06/2022,C&J Website,I'm not the original poster but to reply to the Admin - I believe that what you're asking about is what we're suggesting: Say I've uploaded 6 font weights in 4 varying formats (EOT TTF WOFF WOFF2) - that leaves me with 24 buttons to click to confirm them all after upload.It's not a big deal but it would be a nice streamlining of the process.
21/06/2021,Webflow Admin,Right now it's possible to drag and drop all of your font files onto the upload button at once though it's still required to click the upload font file button to add fonts. Are you referring to a one button click to upload them all? Or a different workflow?
