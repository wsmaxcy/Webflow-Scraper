08/05/2023,YouParcel,Any news about this? Is there a plugin or add-on to use?
24/04/2023,Social Gravity,Hi Webflow team any chance of getting this feature on webflow websites soon?
20/04/2023,Gavin,This would be really important enough so that I'm debating a wp migration just to take advantage of this. It's a core part of SEO.

11/04/2022,Joanna Auburn,Agreed - more SEO tooling is needed in webflow. It would be the reason we need to migrate to another CMS which i dont want to do. :(

15/12/2021,David Haddad,Agreed. Webflow is at a big disadvantage here specially with the latest Google versions (late 2021). Anyone know of a js-based solution for internal linking?
