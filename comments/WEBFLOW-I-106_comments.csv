16/02/2023,Cosmotrade Poland,This is just awful! What the support writes that sites with more than 100 pages start to load badly - complete nonsense. I am disappointed. They also have the guts to tell me that I was not attentive when I started working on their platform because they indicate the limitation in the plan.
14/12/2022,Ross Layton,Agree we use webflow and very keen on the product.  Our company has several apps which contain product pages and support articles. We have used collections as much as possible but are close to hitting the 100 page limit.  Personally I'd be happy to pay an add-on to get this limit increased.  We are currently looking at setting up two projects pushing to the same site which is a lot of work to get around a limit.
14/12/2022,Sergey Gavriluk,For about seven years I have been watching my corporate clients leave webflow due to not having enough static pages. I don't know the real reason why webflow thinks 100 pages is enough but obviously there has to be a trade-off for those who want to be able to.
06/09/2022,Giles Holland,lol this is never going to happen. The 100-page limit is about money period. It forces people to upgrade to CMS. (You could say why not charge extra $ for extra static pages. But that extra $ would either not be as much as they could make from pushing CMS or it would pose problems for justifying why those few extra static pages cost as much as a whole CMS back end.) It's too bad because yes this does seriously hamper building a lot of websites... obviously. But Webflow's actual priority is money not facilitating website building.
09/08/2022,HYPE Studio,Well that’s not difficult at all for a not very large company site.
18/02/2022,Guest,You could use Stacket: https://stacket.app/ and then from there create more pages
04/01/2022,Rafi Khan,Nothing that hasn't already been said but:
06/08/2021,Mario P.,Hi Webflow
05/08/2021,Justin Riney,This 100 page limit is really creating problems for me and my business. Dynamic templates are not a seamless solution and box me in. We are paying good money to host our sites here; this should be unlimited.
03/02/2021,Dave Robertson,I'm really really struggling with the 100 page limit.
05/01/2021,Joel Bantly,Yeah I can't agree enough that this limit needs to be increased.
19/12/2020,Gareth David,Been working on a project for 2 whole weeks only to find today that I cant not go over 100 pages! Now my project is crippled? Cant belive this!It's like InDesign stopping you from making a book more than 100 pages!Please can you lift this and make it unlimited?Why the arbitrary 100 pages?

25/11/2020,Anshela Nancy,No worries there so many professional available online that surely give you the solution of increasing you static pages. Now I am still working on a website that has just 10 pages but my company future plan is to add more than 150 pages on accounting firms london uk based website.
18/11/2020,Josh Taddeo,Do we have any new information on this? I want to move a client over that has at least 200+pages.
17/11/2020,SLYCAN Webflow,plese make this unlimited. the least you could do for the absurd rates we pay each month.
15/10/2020,Jaime Delgado,Dear Webflow team
17/09/2020,Evan O'Donoghue,This could be a dealbreaker.
26/08/2020,Matthew Butler,Please please please please. I know of half a dozen projects myself that have not gone ahead solely because of this limit. That was it. The only reason they are not on webflow was this page limit. I'm fully aware of the CMS but isn't good enough.I would be prepared to pay much more for extra pages! Just add it an hike the price whatever you need to do. But give users who need it the option!I think the number of votes here on this wishlist doesn't capture the loss and lack of seriousness the platform receives from users that simply never choose to use webflow in the first place because of this.
11/08/2020,Alex Rednaxela,I also desperately need this. I really can't stress enough how important it would be for me to even have 150 pages as a limit. I really hope webflow work on this ASAP
