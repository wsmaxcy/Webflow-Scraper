13/07/2022,Sean Conrad,There are many technical enhancements that would make Webflow better BUT this is the most important enhancement. If you continue to frustrate your customers you won't need any of the technical enhacements to the CMS.
06/11/2020,Ovile Wade,I am seen the here amazing blog for users iPhone External Storage Drive so nice update for all of you connecting the i phone all setting
25/12/2019,Harald Vogl,Any feedback per mail in one day would be great already. Growing pains holidays not sure what the reason but I'm waiting meanwhile since 8 days for any answer of a ticket.
15/12/2019,Eric Orlando,Great ideal. Id be willing to pay a fee for some higher level of customer service and immediate help.
02/10/2019,Matt,Calling maybe be a big ask but 24 hour real-time chat may be a more realistic option? If you are waiting a day you are getting a faster email response time than what I am. Based in southern Hemisphere I often wait 3 days... sometimes more.
08/06/2019,Tim Odom,I would like to be able to call as well I work strictly with ecommerce clients and need a "quick realtime" understanding of when some of the future features like POS integration discounts  & coupons paypal checkout will be live.
19/05/2019,John T.,Hey Miguel you're kinda rude budd. Why don't you use Shopify instead of polluting a peaceful and respectful environment they've built here. Webflow is maybe one of the best thing that happened to the web and you acting like an entitled 12y old.
05/03/2019,Webflow Team,First our sincerest apologies for our delay in response. Lately we have been experiencing higher than normal volume. I know this is no excuse but we definitely appreciate your patience while we navigate through our growing pains.
