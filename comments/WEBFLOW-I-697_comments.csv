14/11/2019,Glenn Eastland,+1 very frustrating to have to rebuild collection lists
02/05/2019,Laurence Lee,Gahh... this feature is DESPERATELY needed!
12/04/2019,Rheed MacPherson,Yes please!!! Really need this. SO annoying
25/01/2019,Kev Berot,Even if we could get a Master "Disconnect Collection" Button that would be helpful. It would disconnect all divs connected to that specific collection and it would make the process of reconnecting it to a different Collection easier and faster. I've had to go div by div on one of our site's collection wrappers and it's hard to find all of them sometimes as there's no user feedback on all the divs that contain a connection.Thanks guys!
25/11/2018,Elchin Huseynli,I need it as well. Especially when you create different language versions.
16/10/2018,Max Schwartz,Hi Webflow we use your app for prototyping and love the CMS because we can use 'real data' which makes our prototypes come to life and it also helps us find edge cases. We are a social network for academics and researchers so we are always making lists of research papers and lists of people. It would be really helpful if we could rapidly change the database to another similar database so we don't need to rebuild similar collection lists all the time.  Thanks for all that you do!
04/10/2018,Sean Tubridy,Yes! Such a pain to unlink every item and then link them up again when you want to make a display a new collection based on a different one.
03/05/2018,Alex Cheng,Yes Please!
18/10/2017,Susan MacPhee,I've wanted to do this a number of times. Especially when using templates.
14/09/2017,Brandyss Adams,I really need this!
