27/10/2020,Simeon Zickert,This is a must for good SEO!
18/10/2020,Luis Almanzar Galvan,As an agency this just isn't negotiable. If this isn't in the plans for the near future then we need to switch to wordpress - SEO today isn't something on the backburner its a necessity.
21/08/2020,Simeon Zickert,Why is this still not implemented. really important feature!
18/05/2020,Richard Petrich,No votes left but pls make this happen....
08/11/2019,Domenick Basolo,This isn't done? This really makes me reconsider paying for the service. Nowadays this is a must this isn't an optional thing when creating client websites. This is the most common thing I hear from my clients these days. This shouldn't even be a suggestion it should be implemented.
14/10/2019,Nichole Jones,I don't have any votes yet but please make this a thing :(
07/03/2019,Daniel Blaho,Wordpress can do it with Yoast. It's getting to be more and more important in SEO. Having this as a native feature in Webflow would be a huge win!
19/12/2018,Chuck Braman,From Google 12/19/2018: "Structured data is very helpful to better understand the content on your pages and allows us to highlight your pages in fancy ways in the search results."
15/09/2018,Stephen Parkinson,Shots fired haha
30/07/2018,Stephen Bazley,Wix can do it.
02/05/2018,Alborz Heydaryan,I would love to see this. I'm getting started on SEO for a family business website and this would really help us get an advantage over the competition in search results. Please Webflow!
