15/06/2022,Daniel Sandoval,This. Add this functionality.
23/12/2021,Robert Simmons,Agreed with this one. Even if it's just the minor ability to hit a "redirect to new slug" button when the Editors make changes to the title and slug of the page would be useful.
16/07/2021,Alfie Chen,Yes I'm looking for some ideas too Can we have editor mode to add/delete 301 redirects without designer mode thx
12/07/2021,Carly Bruce Harvey,This is huge. I work on retainer with a lot of marketing teams and they frequently need to be able to add redirects as they change campaigns etc. These marketers should not have full access to the builder JUST so they can add redirects.
01/07/2021,Webflow Admin,Are you looking for a feature that allows a client using only the Editor without Designer access to add/delete redirects?
30/06/2020,Chris Mawer,Feature already exists or has since been introduced. See https://university.webflow.com/article/intro-to-301-redirects
