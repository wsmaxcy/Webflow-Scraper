13/07/2022,Samuel Pawlak,Even if they allow us to export our e-commerce data as a CSV make changes to the CSV then re-upload that would still be way faster. This is currently possible with a regular CMS but not an E-com CMS (yet)
07/10/2021,DANIEL JAMES,Looking after three websites there are clothing sites
26/09/2021,Kaleb - Webflow Developer Australia,This is an absolute must for e-commerce +100 votes. Huge. Thanks Webflow! :)
25/03/2021,John Jackovin,Agree with this as well. Some thought should be put into mass updates. Russell who posted this who sells t-shirts and let's assume there are 20 different t-shirt designs in 3 different colors and 5 different sizes would need to update 300 variants if his cost of a t-shirt jumped 10%. I think a manageable way to do this would be to allow for an edit import.
22/02/2021,Frankie Lyon,Would love the be able to say "oh this shirt is pink? All variants labled pink use pink image."
22/02/2021,Frankie Lyon,PLEEEEASE add this feature.
30/11/2019,Alexandre Morellon,Absolutely !!! Very annoying. Plus having more variants would be quite vital at this point !
