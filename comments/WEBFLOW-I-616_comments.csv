09/12/2020,Dylan Aaron,I think this is to give us an option to customize the thumbnails by ourselves. But as you said if there is an automatically generated thumbnail for those who don't want to edit the image is really a good idea. - Dylan Aaron Shopify theme designer at shopixpert.com
03/12/2020,Brandon Adam,I too encountered with this issue. Since I'm new to CMS I was not able to find its solution. I'm hoping someone will give the answer here.

11/07/2019,Ashwin Kumar,At this homepage learner of Microsoft edge web browser easily comes to know how to open saved passwords in microsoft edge so this is my recommendation for everyone. Thank you so much.
08/06/2017,Sergie Magdalin,I think this is already possible. If you upload a 5000x5000px image to a collection item and then on the website bind this image to a small thumbnail and then bind it to a large image our responsive image algorithm will choose the correct size to serve based on the width of the image.
