15/02/2023,Omer Gold,It's unbelievable that this issue wasn't addressed until now. We have the issue that Google indexed a photo as thumbnail and we must delete it. Contacting support every time is absurd.
07/01/2023,Michael Naylor,Has there been any progress on this item since being reviewed?
14/12/2022,David Ditzler,This seems ridiculous. Is there a way to sync or update the server to remove the data?
23/11/2022,Matt,It blows my mind that issues like this are left years unaddressed. When we as customers delete a file from the website and the assets panel it stands to reason that it should  be deleted from the server. At the least Webflow should make it clear that files are not removed from the server. Not making this clear is negligent. After researching it due to others posting about the same issue with files being later found on Google  I am aware that I can contact support and have them do it but once again it's another ill-conceived unproductive band-aid fix.
25/09/2021,RightAbove Brands,Adding to this if the file was linked for download on the website and google indexed it it will show on google if you look it up.
06/02/2019,Troy Matthew,THIS IS SIGNIFICANT!Â  It is already a problem that it is not "white labeled" and discloses Webflow and then to top it off it permanently exists?!
