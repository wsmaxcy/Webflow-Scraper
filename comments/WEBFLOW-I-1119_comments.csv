07/11/2021,Dion Lovrecich,@webflow why is this still not possible?
21/10/2021,Gerardo Contreras Vacca,Please!
03/06/2021,Philipp,Yes please urgently needed. I waste so much time every month trying to get hold of our invoices. Would be great if you added a separate billing email address.
30/11/2020,Bjørn Mathisen,Today the designer needs to download invoices and upload them to the accounting system manually.
03/09/2020,Luke Menzel,Same problem for us. Designers create the sites but finance wants the invoices each month.
21/05/2020,Jennifer Jäger,upvote from me. The webflow account is used by our designers but the finance department wants to receive the bills. I used the finance department email to set up the account so that they get their email and i use their login. But then when it comes to the webflow support you NEED to write them with the accounts email address which is in that case impossible as I can't go for every problem to the finance department and write an email from their account. A lot of tools have the possibility to set up different emails for billing so would be nice to have in webflow as well :)
04/05/2020,Marianne Johnsen,I am quite surprised that this is not an option! In today's society where we try to  automate as much as possible!! ONE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONALITY is to be able to collect all invoices so that they land inside our accounting system. This is why we NEED TO BE ABLE TO SET A SEPARATE E-MAIL FOR INVOICES! Since this is NOT POSSIBLE TODAY we have to log in download the invoice and upload it to the accounting system This is really a lot of time wasted since you could only offer to set a separate e-mail for this purpose. Imagine doing this for all the different suppliers you have – every single month!!! The ones who start understanding this will get ahead and their clients will be faithful! PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP!
14/02/2019,Andy Phillips,This would save me 5 - 10 minutes every month.
06/02/2019,Devocy Team,Yes this would be real helpful!
