11/05/2022,SÃ©bastien Geldof,Hello all! I support this but want to mention Webshipper here as well it's by far the best fulfilment management tool after having tried so many different ones for our logistics. Would love an integration for it and in general just way more options webflow is very slow at building out the ecommerce side of the product where is all that big funding money going?
