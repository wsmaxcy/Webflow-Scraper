22/10/2021,Hayley Price-Kelly,I added a similar idea and hope this feature will be available soon!
22/06/2021,Turing Studio,Totally agreed please make this feature!
28/04/2021,FACTI Panel Secretariat,Exactly as Yasmina said I also have a project with a grant that expires at year end - but would like to have the website be active for 5 years or more. Need a way to pay in advance for this!
29/03/2021,Yasmina Lembachar,Yes to this! We sometimes need to create websites for projects that eventually end (along with their funding) so it would be helpful to be able to secure at least 2-3 years of hosting beyond the project end and still be able to charge it to the original grant rather than take on those hosting costs ourselves later on.
04/12/2020,Kadeem Spencer,I'm all for it!
13/11/2020,Helen O'Brien,This would be a great additional option
