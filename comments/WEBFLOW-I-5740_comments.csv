13/03/2023,Mario Garcia,I'm not a fan of Framer but I think the prices they handle are fantastic and easier to bring to the Clients. Something similar is needed because the limitation of sites for the FREE and Frelance plans does not really convince me at least for me because the USD currency is very expensive in my country.
