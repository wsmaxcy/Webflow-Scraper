14/05/2017,Pascal Olivet,Nop not cropping. But to force the image to completely fill the space they'd are placed in. For example if you place an image inside a Div to completely fill the space of that Div whatever the Div size and proportion of that Div (and any Overflow from to beÂ automatically hidden).
