18/01/2021,Stephanie Mondello,A place to add editor notes on page Sections seen on the back-end but invisible to the front-end. I use VS code as well and I like the fact I can add notes. Then when I have to go back to a client site I can review the notes on the section so I know what I did and refresh my memory.
