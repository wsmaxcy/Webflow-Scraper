03/08/2017,Jeffrey Gillespie,@Sergie Magdalin I’ve made this idea clearer by placing an example
12/05/2017,Jeffrey Gillespie,There should be a page where it has a list of all your nav links button links and text link on each page of your site and it should tell you if a hyperlink is attached to the link. Something like this - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CfA4j_CCeFg
11/05/2017,Webflow Team,Jeffrey can you clarify more what you mean? Thanks!
