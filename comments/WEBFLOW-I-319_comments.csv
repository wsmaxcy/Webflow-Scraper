21/04/2021,Sarwar Monaf,Homepage ought to alternate however. I do not prefer to have to replace a bunch of hyperlinks manually when the domestic web page changes move in specials without application fee. I'd like to simply be in a position to pick out "Current Homepage

01/02/2017,Webflow Team,What if when you set the link to "Home" it will always point to the home even if you set another page as the homepage? This way we wouldn't have to show "Home" and "Current Homepage" in the page link list.
