06/04/2023,Hari Prasath,Why are there so few votes for this one? Does nobody want this feature? I thought literally anybody with a background working with photoshop illustrator or figma would love to have this feature.

04/01/2023,Ben Biazar,Moving an element between many elements that have children is a hard task and it becomes annoying when we misplace elements. Please make a shortcut or fix the UI so we can navigate the elements better. Thank you.
