29/03/2023,Thiago Pauli,I don't know why they launched this incompleted feature only the owner of the agency workspace can access the client workspace everybody else that pays and is supposed to have access too can't... What's the purpose of this? The benefit of having an agency plan is to allow everybody to work on our website after we pass the website to the client workspace only the workspace owner can access it... I really don't get what they thought.
