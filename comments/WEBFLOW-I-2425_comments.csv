06/12/2022,Drains to Ocean,Everyone praises Webflow I have not been impressed one bit as of yet. My order numbers are scrambled from one order to the next. My orders show random strange taxes.
21/06/2022,Samuel Pawlak,This is a must have!
02/11/2021,Carmen Stewart,After switching from Shopify to Webflow ecommerce I'm really disappointed that something as simple as designating a starting order number to enable continuity for my business isn't provided by Webflow.
19/11/2020,Kevin Holland,Working on learning more about this myself. Not much to go on so far :(
15/05/2020,Tamar Pinder,My exact issue; an existing business with an already Order Number system in place. It would be great if I could've start webflow ecommerce order numbers at my last order.
