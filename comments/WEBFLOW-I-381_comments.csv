08/11/2021,Guest,I developed a tool that pushes the whole webflow site to github everytime you hit the publish button!
03/10/2021,Jarek Lipski,I created Webflow Git - a simple free utility to track changes to a Webflow site on GitHub. It’s a kind of version control system supporting the Backup that can monitor changes to the generated stylesheet as well as pages content. It currently doesn't support hosting the exported sites and it only extracts text content (so no images movies etc.) It doesn't require any permissions to Wenflow account.
26/07/2021,Dan James,This would be a game changer.
18/01/2021,Bartosz Erbert,
17/12/2020,Mike Schuman,I have to say I have just subscribed and may cancel due to the inavailabilty of this integration.
28/11/2020,Macrometa Corporation,I'm kind of shocked this feature still isn't available. Could you at least create an export api endpoint?
24/05/2019,Erik Aronesty,You can automate a pub to zip/unpack/commit/push.... not that bad.
24/03/2019,Ilias Ismanalijev,This would be useful to improve webflow for webapp development. You could link webflow to your php back-end in an easier way for example.
20/08/2018,Nick Soper,This makes me think that for this feature to work you would need to be able to add notes every time you published. So I added that idea: https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1402
18/07/2018,Flávio Henrique Cardoso de Freitas,this transform webflow in outher step
16/01/2018,Marcelo Gonzaga,With Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket support please! :)
25/12/2017,Marco Sylvestre,Can't agree more !
