26/07/2021,Glamorous Ninja,there can be a text style selector in the creator there's no genuine explanation there couldn't be a similarly utilitarian symbol selector in a comparable board. This is quite crucial stuff. What's more indeed there are potential workarounds (none of which have worked for Google Material Icons) however Webflow's entire worth prop is going to considerable lengths out of improvement. How about we get a legitimate symbol selector folks.
30/07/2020,Alex Dixon,+1 It would be very useful if Font Awesome had a supported integration with Webflow.
30/04/2020,Ashley Lombart,I have been in web designing field from last 3 years and web flow community helps me a lot can anybody tell me can do no human verification for comments on some specific pages.
30/04/2020,Ashley Lombart,That is a great idea
22/01/2019,Jacob Wright,Google's Material Icons set is on their font hosting (https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons). Could that at least get added to the dropdown list of Google fonts?
21/10/2018,Moshe Morris,I also would like to see a more user-friendly means of adding icon fonts.  I have literally spent a few hours trying to get Font Awesome to work with Webflow to no avail.  I have followed every tutorial I could find (including one mentioned in this thread) and nothing works.
30/05/2018,PS Werbung,Hey really that should be as easy as adding a Font from Google Fonts. We need this for all kind of call to actions =)
08/03/2018,Thaddeus Kilo,I have to agree with this request. I am a seasoned developer and have tried over and over to get Google Material Icon set to work in webflow to literally no avail. I've tried uploading the actual font files and even referencing Google Web Fonts via the html approach. Zilch. All i get is a square where the icon should be.
17/08/2017,Cameron Wethal,Claudiu Limban Thanks so much for taking the time out to show how to correctly use font-awesome with webflow! Very much appreciated.
10/05/2017,Claudiu Limban,I've made a video about how to add FontAwesome to Webflow
09/02/2017,VanNoppen Marketing,Adding a library of icons to the "Elements" panel that can be used (dragged and dropped) right out of the gates without having to manually add a font library yourself or add/upload individual icons as images is a must. One of Webflow's competitors Froont (https://froont.com/) incorporates a large and customizable icon library nicely in their designer it would make sense for Webflow to add it as well.
08/02/2017,Nathaniel Perales,Yeah this is already built into Webflow like Christoph Wisotzki said.
27/01/2017,Christoph Wisotzki,You can already do that... Just upload the fontawesome font & use the fontawesome cheatsheet to copy and paste your items. No need to integrate that into webflow.
23/01/2017,Gabriel Brodersen,This is quite critical for speeding up web design!
18/01/2017,Sergie Magdalin,I think "be able to drag the individual icons over like any other element and then style with CSS font properties" can be done without icon fonts. We can use normal inline SVG's with "currentColor" as the fill color and it will take the color from font styles. More info on SVG currentColor on the forums. Way cleaner and simpler than font icons and this allows icons to behave more like images which makes more sense than inline text that requires a special reference sheets to get the right icon.
