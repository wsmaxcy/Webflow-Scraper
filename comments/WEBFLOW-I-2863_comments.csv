04/04/2023,Johnny Bamboo,Dude you see a horizontal ruler? WHERE!? I've been looking for a damn ruler in Webflow and have been absolutely unsuccessful. I've seen posts from the co-founder back in 2014 stating there will be a ruler.... it's now 2023 and I still don't see a ruler. I'm just absolutely shocked that a fundamental tool like a ruler is missing from an application that promotes not needing code and being more of a design oriented approach to building websites. I love what they have built don't get me wrong not knocking but I do think they could have done this by now... it's been years.
