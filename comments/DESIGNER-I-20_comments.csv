30/03/2022,Barbara Prusiewicz,Any update on this from webflow team?My basic requirement is that I want to populate some form fields based on CMS item values. Is the solution custom code from sygnal ?  Setting default values for form fields based on context or dynamic data seems like a very common requirement.
20/10/2021,Michael Wells,There are some scriptable ways to do this that will serve until Webflow adds this kind of capability. My Webflow Util library specifically started with the feature of databinding a SELECT to a Collection List.

19/12/2019,Alex Dixon,This feature would be super useful for many use cases such as booking forms.
19/12/2019,Reid Niermann,Would be very helpful!
10/12/2019,Txell Gimenez,please!!
08/09/2019,Matteo Grand,This needs to exist. Perfect example use case is a client of mine that would rather have an 'enquire now' form for each of her artworks rather than the option of buying online. We currently can't set dynamic form names in the product template so we don't know which artwork the User is enquiring about without adding a dropdown asking the user to select the artwork they're currently viewing.
27/06/2019,Okantan Ayeh,This would be so useful!! Any updates???!
