20/02/2023,David Downing,if you won't bring back client billing at least have an account option for the CLIENT to control the site and allow access to a designer/developer. The current Workspace options seem to lean toward freelancers/agencies/etc that want "more control over code" or to "scale their team". I want my client to own their own domain/hosting accounts and let me access it without them paying for all the agency-type functionality they do not need. The reason I am paying is so i could host multiple sites export code and have Webhost bill them directly. If i have to do the billing or have the client set up their own paid account then i'm not sure why i'm paying money. Without client bililng (even if it stopped being marked up) it seems i need to use that export code option and host elsewhere as you've removed some key functionality that i wanted.
08/01/2023,Matan Assulin,Just adding that I agree and client billing should come back! This was a great feature people loved. No one hated it and if it frustrated anyone they could freely use bonsai or something else anyway. Like this is just an opinional feature why remove it. I really hope webflow brings this back someday!
20/11/2022,MyCenturaHealth,I think they should just bring back the existing client billing feature and never work on it.
21/10/2022,Ryan Hale,Client Billing was part of why I chose to adopt Webflow in the first place. Taking over this admin function will preprent tons of unbillable time for my team. I know they've provided a referral to a third party service for this but it still requires admin to reconcile these costs (between platforms). If cost is the issue please just offer Client Billing as an paid add-on.
23/06/2022,Maxx Berkowitz,client billing worked so well!! honestly was a HUGE reason I evangelized your praises made being a freelancer and maintaining multiple clients so easy. adding a fee on top honestly was just icing on the cake. but you've introduced a huge hassle now. I'll have to create individual accounts for each client and remember their emails hope passwords don't change...
17/06/2022,Kevin Handy,Client Billing as is works better than the alternative but I'd rather have another option.  I feel I may be in the minority here but I'd rather the opposite of things now.  I don't want to be involved in billing at all.
08/06/2022,Julian Galluzzo,This is absolutely ridiculous - and the reasons given for retiring this feature are laughable.
07/06/2022,Simon Heger,Webflow does not need to build its own global payment solution as they say in various statements. You can pay Webflow by credit card. You will always be able to do that. Well - with clever user management (customer has a login designer has the rights) surely the customer can just do this himself? Squarespace makes that easy.Or just bring back the existing client billing feature and never work on it. Better than none.
24/05/2022,Guest,Guys they can probably bring this back someday. Just use some other cool products for billing for now.
24/05/2022,Joseph Barajas,Yeah this is disappointing. Don't want to sign up and pay for another monthly bill.
18/05/2022,Jared Dundas,
10/05/2022,Russell Gathright,This move sucks imo.  Not to be rude but sometimes blunt is best.  I was in love with webflow now my heart is broken.  Sure webfllow wasn't perfect and we had our problems but this is a major dissapointment a letdown an unfufilled expectation.  Oh the drama.  That'll learn me to remember to be cynical about my software.
05/05/2022,Rob Main,looks like webflow will be losing a lot of clients this way sadly.
03/05/2022,Alan Owens,Sadly if this goes ahead WebFlow will lose all my clients.  I will transition to another all in one supplier similar to webflow.
23/04/2022,Elected,Not going to lie... I think its a good idea that Webflow drops the Client Billing... being in Australia and having to bill clients in USD was always doing my head in about 6 months ago I started using Bonsai and absolutly love it. Its so easy to use and it makes seeing if all your clients have paid your invoices an absolute breeze. It does client billing the way it should be and has everything that Webflow didn't or sucked at.
19/04/2022,Brent Lagerman,I'm probably in the minority here I would much rather webflow put their devs to work on sorely needed improvements to the core product like adding WebP image support as opposed to maintaining client billing.  They have made a good alternative available (bonsai)
15/04/2022,Laura Campbell,this puts me in an awkward situation. i've retired and i don't want to have to go back to work figuring this out and having to renegotiate with my client on payment.
14/04/2022,Guest,The Client Billing Code is a field on the filing workflow that allows users to associate each transaction with a certain client. You can enter whatever terms or descriptors your firm uses internally to differentiate client cases.
