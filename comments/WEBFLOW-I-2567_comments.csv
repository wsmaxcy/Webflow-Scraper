07/06/2023,Corinne Prainito,Any update on this? I'm with Daniel James - I wouldn't be able to get away with an ecommerce or portfolio website without this feature. Ive included an example https://www.converse.com.au/womens-converse-chuck-taylor-all-star-lift-valentines-day-high-top-black-a05138-black - click on the hero image and then zoom away on the lightbox image.
02/11/2020,Stefan Werner,I think the zoom function still doesn't exist. What I also miss is the ability to upload images as a package (for instance 50 or more images) instead I have to load each image individually into the lightbox. Have I overlooked a function that already makes it possible?
11/05/2020,Bob Sidebotham,This would be a wonderful addition to lightbox.
11/05/2020,Jacob Marciniec,Huge must-have.
19/04/2020,DANIEL JAMES,I do not know of any e-commerce site that does not have this.
