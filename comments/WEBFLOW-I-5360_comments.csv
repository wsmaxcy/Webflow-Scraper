01/11/2022,Michael Wells,I've done some research on this 410's actually won't make a difference to Google SEO. Have a read here.
31/10/2022,Morgan Decker,Not having the ability to serve status 410 can really kill SEO for an ECommerce website. For example I manage an artist's online store in Webflow. My client introduces Planters as a category they don't sell very well so she wants to remove them from her site. My only option is to have the page 404 (bad for SEO) or I could 301 redirect it to a different page. If my planter category is gone from the website where would I redirect this to? Paintings? There is no logical place I could redirect someone looking for planters when planters are no longer being sold on the website. Not to mention this creates misleading and confusing search results which I can do literally nothing about without 410. Sometimes status 410 is needed particularly for SEO please make this possible!
