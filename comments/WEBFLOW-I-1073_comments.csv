06/12/2019,Øyvind Østmo,This is so important! Every single site we make we have to make tricky workarounds with images posing as background images. Especially when it's populated by the CMS where clients constantly forget image sizing and upload huge stock images.

12/01/2019,Tim Vyas,This seems like a no brainer. Just ran some speed checks on my Google Analytics account and it's crushing my mobile load times having larger resolution backgrounds for desktop devices. Come on Webflow!
19/09/2018,Jess Leondiou,I would also LOVE to see this idea come to life background images are such a great design element it would be so fantastic if they resized!
13/04/2018,Michael Parks,Totally! This is very needed. I am surprised it was not a quick follow after inline but anyway please asap awesome Webflow team.
