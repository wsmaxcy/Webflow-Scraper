09/02/2020,Justin Beckman,I totally agree it would be awesome to have Instgram integration built into Webflow. I would totally be willing to pay for one of the third-party integrations for this but it's hard for me to sell a client on a monthly fee for their IG feed. A one-time fee is no problem because I just integrate that into their invoice. For example I've been using the Elfsight IG for Wordpress for several years but it's a one-time fee with lifetime updates. Elfsight for Webflow however is a monthly (unless you know for sure you can keep your limit under 200 per month then it's free).
30/09/2018,Julien V.,I agree a responsive widget for Instagram should be available in addition to Twitter and Facebook there is a high demand.
04/05/2017,Zac Lazare,Connie is right. Instagram feeds are in high demand. I have three projects in the queue at the moment and they all want Instagram feeds on their sites. Please please...pretty please add this feature!
14/02/2017,Connie Sawatzky,Totally agree.  FB seems to becoming less active and instagram is the new leader.  Don't code so am totally stuck here! Would love to have a feed show or at least a drag and drop. Would be awesome.
