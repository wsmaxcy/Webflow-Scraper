14/12/2022,Rob,Was this wish ever granted?
04/09/2022,Keenan Price,This blows my mind that Webflow hasn't done anything about this... This is INCREDIBLY simple to implement from a coding standpoint... Why in the world is this not a thing?!
05/07/2022,Hamish Palmer,Important for us as well to show individual variables and wrap them with a bit of basic HTML.
22/02/2022,Eric Schmitt,Still interested in this!
18/08/2021,Guy Magen,Please add this!! :O
11/02/2021,Cheeyoon Lee,PLEASE
25/11/2020,Erin Gusty,Insane that this doesn't exist yet.
24/11/2020,Andrew Fiorentino,How is it possible that people have been complaining about this for 3-4 years and no action has been taken?
29/10/2020,Gerald Chang,come on

02/05/2020,Hürkan Gökkaya,Come on Webflow. only put an id or name to subject line so we can understand form inputs difference easily from Subject. Gmail collect them in a same email because title is same.
22/04/2020,Eli Bailey,As a business owner who receives 10-20 leads per day it is wildly annoying and confusing that the subject line cannot be modified with form or dynamic data.
27/02/2020,John Conrad,I am not sure about this feature that you are discussing. Because i did not even saw it. Also you can hire College Essay Writers to complete your quality assignments easily. I am gonna update it and must avail this new feature of e mails.
04/01/2020,Naomi Loy,Please create support for this!
17/04/2019,Alexander,I'm not sure why this feature along with other more advanced email functions aren't added yet. For business sites these are very very important but yet Webflow team is prioritizing on things which are less critical.
21/10/2018,Joao Neto,Please 12 months and this feature is not available yet?GMAIL groups all messages in the same thread its bad!
24/01/2018,Samuel,Duplicate of https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-450#merged-ideas
13/12/2017,Brad Poirier,Yes another website builder I use has this now.
