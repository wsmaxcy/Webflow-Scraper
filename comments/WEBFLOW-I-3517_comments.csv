17/05/2022,Alan Alston,Maybe it's a Starter site issue. I'm upgrading to a Site Plan later; maybe I get more multi-images then; or at least more than 25.
10/02/2022,Guy Borghouts,Hi James I'm having the same issue regarding the limit of 25 images. How did you solve it to display more images as one coherent gallery?
30/07/2021,Ben Kilah,How is this not a thing? - Can we please get this limit increased.
27/11/2020,Tommaso Berti,Hi James I need to do the same and I'm struggling to find a way to merge the fields in the same gallery.
