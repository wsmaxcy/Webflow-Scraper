15/02/2019,Michael Anglin,I agree. Even if the Pro account had to have a minimum number of hosted sites or such to have the free hosting for the Pro user. Reward Pro accounts as they add more paid sites. Maybe some kind of reward system to scale as more sites are added?
14/11/2018,Ayame,When I saw the Pro account I thought it would be included I was a bit disappointed to find that it wasn't. Where I am the Pro account + CMS hosting adds up to be around $90+ per month and it seems to be going up every month too.
