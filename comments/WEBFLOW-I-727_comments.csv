14/02/2021,Jose Blenda,One of my top requests to speed things up.
01/02/2021,Alex Young-Davies,I couldn't agree more with this. Especially as your site grows having just a giant list of interaction names to scroll through can get cumberson and confusing.
12/10/2020,Daniel Curran,@webflow this item should be merged with this other wish list item:
21/07/2020,Gecko Robotics,This would be incredibly useful!
30/01/2020,Nathan Earl,My interactions/animations list are turning into a nightmare.I'm building an entire web app here on Webflow and it's insane how many animations are on each page.  As soon as I start building out 40 pages with 10 animations MINIMUM on each PAGE... Oye...  We need folders.  Bad.
15/05/2018,Matthew P Munger,This needs more votes! Interactions lists on my sites are so long. It's hard to find things and know what still being used.
10/04/2018,Jonathan Friedman,Let's also add the ability to sort by name create date etc... because currently even relying on a naming convention is only marginal (without sort you still can't effectively group by name)
19/09/2017,Victor Brangolo,I was having the same thought.
