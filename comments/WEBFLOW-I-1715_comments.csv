01/06/2022,Cody Arsenault,please add them asap. i have to use someone else because of this when i really dont want too.
19/04/2022,Maria Montiel,Please add Authorize.net! I built a platform for one on my clients on webflow since it gives me a lot of design freedom but unfortunately her bank is only supported by authorize.net.
05/01/2022,Aykut GÃ¼rkan,My client is looking for alternatives because webflow does not support klarna or pre-payment options. It's a dealbreaker for many. Hope and wish this could be delivered very very soon
18/03/2021,Dexter Washington,I just had to take a client over to shopify becuase Webflow does not support this just yet. It would be a great feature to have. I'm tired of losing clients to situations like this & other plug ins that other platforms have
05/02/2021,Darek Berg,I agree. I was forced to move an e-commerce cigar merchant over to WooCommerce / Authorize.net because he wouldn't qualify for a regular merchant account. I'd love to have Authorize.net and it's extensive connectivity with various processors as an option for Webflow websites.
13/01/2020,Kidwuf Wolfe,Bringing this back
21/04/2019,Anil Motwani,Agreed! Payment facilitators such as stripe have a merchant processing limit of $1 million annually which leaves larger merchants utilizing the traditional setup through authorize.net and NMI. This is much needed.
