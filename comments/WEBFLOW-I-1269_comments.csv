07/08/2021,Arremz Tife,I just finished writing a case study on my webflow website portfolio and I really want to add an interactive prototype to my case study just to add icing on the cake it would be nice tohave
23/01/2019,Guest,on the website marvelapp should not be necessery any more if we have this possibility juste the way 'webflow>showcase!' already works  .. but do I create this myself? Error for Webflow mobile version that you can NOT see the showcase smaller/responsive! for example https://webflow.com/website/kailash-design
23/01/2019,Guest,i also want that.. layout of a phone around my webapp.  so p'eople can say the website already from out my portfolio!  look to the Behance portfolio example   that for my should need to be an embed code from de webapp https://www.behance.net/gallery/46544111/inMuseum-Audio-Guide-App-for-Museums-Tours
