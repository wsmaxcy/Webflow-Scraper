13/08/2021,Sarah Loh,Any update yet?
12/05/2021,Gregory Matthews,Can somebody from WebFlow let us know if this request is in the pipeline?
30/03/2021,R JEFFERY WILSON,Hard to believe this hasn't happened yet. Trying to sell this platform to a client right now. No pagination numbers doesn't help. Folks please get with the program.
25/03/2021,Semwerkt,So much needed!!!
03/03/2021,Sam,This is basic pagination functionality that I've had clients request. Would be great to see it implemented.

05/11/2020,Pipeline Team,Have had multiple clients request this.
13/09/2020,Juloz A,Much needed!
11/09/2020,Sofia L,Need this!
29/08/2020,Paul Ferguson,Pretty basic functionality – either a built-in feature or a workaround would be helpful.
26/08/2020,Kyle Morrow,need this!
12/08/2020,Nathan Steele,SERIOUSLY?!!! Touting one's self as a CMS and no page numbers for pagination 😂 😂 😂
17/07/2020,Chris Pauley,Many assume this feature is in webflow because it does have pagination but then when you get a client asking for it (or perhaps its even built in during the design phase) it is beyond embarrassing to have to walk that back because it is literally impossible on the platform you've picked. This should be a very trivial feature to add unsure why this basic feature has been requested for years and it has not been implemented.
24/06/2020,Stephanie DeWald,Had a client request this for their podcast blog today. Felt a bit embarrassed to tell them it wasn't a feature!
28/05/2020,Carlos Mario Rosas,Hi guys I love Webflow but please this is a must on the basics.
12/05/2020,.N,I love your product but sometimes it seriously feels like you Guys are adding a Feautures just to have them but don't bother to actually implement them properly... I was seriously surprised when I realised this doesnt exist. Please make this happen!
28/11/2019,Tomas Marek,@Webflow we really needs Page numbers not just text page count. Please :)
28/09/2019,Tiada Guru,This would be *super* helpful... a bit shocked it's not available.Why have pagination without having page numbers?
