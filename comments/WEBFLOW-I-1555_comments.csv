12/06/2023,Jeroen Bruijn,common webflow without ideal your ecommerce functionality is not usable at all.
08/06/2023,Michael Ladru,Takes way to long... Webflow
08/05/2023,Tim Sytema,Come on webflow make this happen after 5 years...
29/04/2023,Xiaoli Li,Yes please make this happen üò¢üôè
24/04/2023,Promptz Co,ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
24/04/2023,Martijn Hoppenbrouwer,Anybody gotten anything working properly already?We're about to start investing a lot of time to do it ourselves with mollie and the Webflow API but this should be default/natively supported!
17/04/2023,Kai van Mil,And guys if (when!) you build this make sure to get it right with recurring payments: the first payment is done via iDeal and the rest that come after are SEPA Direct Debit. Please don't make the first payment a SEPA without the iDeal step this prevents identity verification and promotes fraud.
14/04/2023,Quizness,Come on guys! This cannot be that hard... The Netherlands is waiting for this.
03/01/2023,Jort Steinebach,The market for this might be small initially but once it picks up I am sure it'll even get big here in the Netherlands - as everyone is so hyped about Webflow... if Webflow is not integrating this they're definitely missing their shot...
20/12/2022,Sjoerd,It's very frustrating that iDeal is not possible through Webflow.
13/12/2022,Pier Stein,Guess this will never happen..?
09/12/2022,Timo Smeding,Come one...
05/12/2022,Techtolia Techtolia,Accept iDEAL and up to 25+ payment methods with a single integration for your Shopify Store through Stripe.
09/11/2022,Semih Yƒ±lmaz,That‚Äôs it I‚Äôm done with Webflow. Been waiting for this simple request for years and clearly Webflow folks have other priorities. Then I guess this is not the right platform for me.
25/10/2022,Malik Nbr,Can someone from the Webflow Team go to their Stripe dashboard and click "enable iDeal"?
25/10/2022,FERROLIGHT DESIGN,Make it happen please.
19/10/2022,Astute Agency,Dear Webflow
03/10/2022,Thomas,This is truly insane... 4 years of waiting I think I'd maybe just accept and go back to Wordpress...
03/10/2022,Guido Westra,Also waiting for this.
13/09/2022,Finn Nijman,PLEASE....
