02/07/2021,Sean,to flush this one out a bit more please add a waitlist for sold out items. Allow me to add X stock and have email alert options for 1) the first X that were added to the list or 2) everybody on the list but item still shows “sold out” but “in stock” if product is opened from email link string or 3) everybody on list gets an email and stock is shown on website for all non-list customers as well.
