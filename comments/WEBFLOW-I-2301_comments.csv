27/02/2023,Silenus Development,To be honest it is ridiculous that you can't set different shipping options per product. Even on Woocommerce this is basic functionality
25/01/2023,DANIEL JAMES,Simply a must.
28/12/2022,Ryan Bavetta,This is a pretty essential feature. Things with similar costs can have vastly different shipping costs. There's no good way to make this work now other than including shipping costs in product prices which isn't always the best idea.
10/06/2022,Tim Daff,Adding my vote to this following client requesting exactly this...
04/02/2022,Deer Island Studio,Pretty please Webflow? This is very clunky for our clients and embarrassing to explain.
04/11/2021,Kelsie Trainor,YES PLEASSSSEEEEE
01/11/2021,Rhys Dyson,Definitely a necessary feature for ecommerce.How can you compare the $2.60 vs $16.80 shipping costs for a single book vs a box of 20?Am I suppose to just charge $20 shipping per order to cover all bases?
15/09/2021,Sean,I'd like to go one further and have prices optionally based on product variants metadata (weight quantity dimensions ...) in addition to products (OP) or even category of products.
17/08/2021,Josh Thackray,may have to move to shopify as they support shipping rates by product
17/06/2021,Lucinda Moore,I am completely baffled by the oversight on shipping costs based on indivdual products. Not only can I NOT get real-time shipping costs. I'm unable to separate items that ship at a cost of $55 compared to an item that costs $8. How is this not possible? I'm about to lose a client due to his lack of feature.
09/06/2020,Simeon Zickert,I am really missing showing the shipping cost in the cart when a customer is hitting the add to cart button.Thinking about upselling Products and getting the customer to as many Products to get over a specific Price point for getting free shipping this is a very important feature.this feature must also be for the guys at webflow highly interesting as they get a procentual fee of every sell made over their system.
29/05/2020,Liam Day,Printful have an API for calculating shipping costs. An integration with this would remove the need to manually enter shipping rates.
25/05/2020,Drew Eastmead,this is needed.
19/05/2020,William Wong,+1
23/04/2020,Lewis Bamber,This would be brilliant. It would be one way of getting around the zone based shipping.
04/03/2020,Josh Thackray,totally agree need to link a shipping method to a product..
24/10/2019,Brad,To tell you the truth I am kind of surprised that this is not an option.Â  I am also surprised that more people have not asked for this.
