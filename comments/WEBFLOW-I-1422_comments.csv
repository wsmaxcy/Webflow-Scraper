07/06/2023,Patrick Luzny,This strikes me as a low effort high-reward feature to implement given the nearly 1000 (as of this writing) votes.
24/05/2023,Gregory Brewton,This is pretty much a necro post at this point but here it goes: Webflow is the only site builder I use. I always built all of my sites and applications from scratch. Most (not all) are Mongo Express React Node stack because of the flexibility and control and most importantly the ability to build for the web and have a platform-agnostic app on a phone or desktop. I've built a few PWAs by hand so I know it can be a pain but I would love to see this feature. My clients would love it and would likely be willing to pay for it.

05/04/2023,Yannick Caron,This would be awesome since I love using Webflow to design and build web-apps. the only thing is that turning a webflow project into a pwa is such a hassle now. You have to either use progressier webviewgold or any other solution that i might not be aware of.

24/10/2021,Sandro Hagen,Come on let's make root directory access happen for this! Its 2021 and soon 2022! :-)
06/10/2021,Maximilian M√§ser,They should just add the option to access the root directory to make us create a service worker!
14/09/2021,Lucas,This seems a MUST have in 2021. Let's do it !
29/06/2021,Guest,In Africa everybody access the internet through a phone but a signal is not always available when we use local cache they can still see the website without internet connection (of course they need to visit the website before when there is internet)

25/06/2021,Roarke Clinton,So this wishlist item "has been reviewed"! What now?
25/06/2021,Abel Garcia,This is a nice and powerful feature to add...!!!
20/05/2021,John McCarley,I understand that PWA's may not be part of your roadmap nor the company goal but a simple workaround would be allowing root-domain-level file uploads.
26/01/2021,Roheel Shafique,Please add this feature ... in the mean time can anyone guide me what is the alternative to this if you wanna stay with Webflow
