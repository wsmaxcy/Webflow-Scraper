29/05/2023,Lomaro Caldwell,Any progress in this function? This is basic and essential
15/05/2023,Paul Coertjens,I just now realized that this is not possible. However essential
09/03/2023,Seth Reese,This is such a basic and vital function for clients. It's stupid and cumbersome for them to email me a file every time they want to make a simple change. This isn't a problem in Wordpress sites. You need to make this work.
16/02/2023,Paul Irwin,Just realising this can't be done in Webflow. I'm going to be having a horrible conversation with the client trying to explain why this basic functionality of a CMS is missing. Please can this be addressed. Thanks!
19/01/2023,Uwe Thomaschky,This is also a problem for us. It would be nice if this could be solved in a timely manner.
20/11/2022,Peter Laundy,Would be very useful to our Guest Editors. Seems a no-brainer feature.
29/06/2022,Farewell Media,Any movement on this yet?
22/12/2021,Marathon Studio,Any progress in this function? .(
21/05/2021,Peter Van Laer,We currently have a collection with a file upload field but this is confusing because the slug's for uploaded files show up in the link selector of the editor but don't link to the actual file since the slug does not have page because it's merely created when a file is uploaded. We need a dedicated assets collection in the editor so that can users can upload files from the editor and link to them from eg. richt text links in the editor. Currently we have to tell clients to copy the direct link for the asset and past it as an external link in the editor. This works but it's a very cumbersome process.
27/04/2021,Richard Hogan,Yep. This is a much needed feature. Please add this sooner than later.
08/01/2021,Josh Brown,Man. I agree with all these comments. I'm using webflow long enough to discover all these small petty issues. Why can we not link to PDFs using the rich text element OR the Editor? I don't understand.
14/12/2020,Jonny Growfox,Any updates on this?
26/10/2020,Rachel Shannon,Agreed with other comments .. this is urgently needed!!
28/09/2020,Katja Perez,This is urgently needed. Webflow please add this function!
28/05/2020,Hamish Maclean,This is a really nasty client usability issue. It goes hand in hand with the fact there is no editor asset manager for clients. Site editors need easy content management.
19/05/2020,Jiri Sostok,there is already a link option to a page why not to add a link to a file? This is really something I would like to see. Thanks in advance.
20/02/2020,Stephan Nabbe,Hi Webflow
15/01/2020,Stephan Nabbe,Dear Webflow
07/05/2019,PS Werbung,Very basic for a real «classic cms competitor» which webflow want's to be!
01/05/2019,Graham Barr,This seems such as basic feature. Why have it in normal text links but not in a RTE? C'mon Webflow I cannot believe this is nothing more than an oversight?
