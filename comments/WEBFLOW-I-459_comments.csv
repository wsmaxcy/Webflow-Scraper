05/10/2020,Garrett R,Very important it's a worry that this has been on the list so long.
01/10/2020,Silent House,This would really help speed up my website's load time (which is currently background video heavy) but if those videos could be loaded while the rest of the site is active would be clutch!

24/03/2020,Arnel Bukva,My agency loves using webflow but due to a plethora of complaints from our clients about this feature (among others) not being available we are planning to move all our clients to a alternative hosting and recreating their websites i wordpress unless this feature gets added before the end of summer.

19/02/2020,Claudia Weason,please add
06/02/2020,Peter Farrell,Please please please enable this feature ASAP!
05/02/2020,Austin Mullins,This is one of several features that I can't believe isn't already there and also find troubling that Webflow doesn't seem to consider it an urgent thing to attend to.
