06/08/2020,Giles Holland,It's not the same thing. There's nothing in the custom animations that give you easing open/close (even though you can trigger animations by dropdown opening/closing). Basically this feature exists for a mobile nav menu but for some reason is missing for regular dropdown lists and there is no clear workaround.
