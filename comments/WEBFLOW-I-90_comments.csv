18/06/2022,Petros Topouzis,Yeah this is a huge issue for us too!
15/04/2022,Lennart Hennig,Come on webflow! 4 years?! This is so essential! Can't build a simple event page because of the way you limit multi references!
20/05/2021,TRUE,Yes this is a must – although I'm surprised that not more people have voted for that. I've got two sites now where I need this. One of them I can work around by splitting across pages – although it's a point to do and terrible for UX. The other site I can't workaround it. sucks.
27/09/2020,Cresco Group,Solid feature that sets you apart from Wix Square Crap etc. But we need an ability for more that one nested collection to be used on one page.
11/11/2019,Jenevine Biscocho,Upvoting this because I wanted to use Collections as a workaround for Editors not being able to add alt tags for images. I created a Collection for the images that need alt text but on my homepage I already hit the limit of 20 Collections! As something that was requested by the client I would love a way for an Editor to add their own alt tag text whether directly in the Editor or through a workaround like Collections.
07/12/2018,Cloudrocket,I've spoken to a Webflow engineer about this and apparently it is a technical limitation due to how collection lists are rendered. Adding many collection lists on one page (especially when it contains collection references) makes rendering the page horribly slow.
02/08/2018,Emmanuel Kaska,Hey guys I'm working with a large client that would pay considerably for this functionality.
25/05/2018,Jens Vahle,Same here. Wanted to create a portfolio site with image galleries in a slider. Used the 20 collection lists quite fast and don't think it's possible to build this site anymore.
03/01/2018,Mark Willis,I thought there would be a lot more votes than this. This has stopped me dead in my tracks. I too would pay more for this feature.
14/09/2017,Brandyss Adams,I need this to create an onscreen calendar or to sort blog content by letter --20 allotted  but there are 26 letters...I'm crying right now ;(
03/04/2017,Jay Bussiere,I would PAY to have more dynamic lists.   Please consider.
28/01/2017,Jay Bussiere,For long one pagers this is essential to have more.  I just hit the 20 limit.
