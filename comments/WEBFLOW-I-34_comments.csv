15/04/2022,Sean Tubridy,Really could use this to style different classes of items differently. Surprised Finsweet or someone else hasn't come up with a workaround.
29/03/2022,Hans Gijsbers,Still missing why?
22/07/2020,Timothy Luke,This seems so obviously integral am I missing something?
20/07/2019,Derrick Threatt,Upvote
16/06/2019,Den Up,
28/03/2019,Nick Merrigan,Yes please!
02/11/2018,Josh Chamberlain,Yes. For example a CMS-powered list of features and ones with the "Important" label get a different color background and a drop shadow.
21/05/2018,Jon So,We need this very badly to use to show/hide content on multi-language sites.
18/01/2017,Diarmuid Sexton,This would be great for styling different objects by their category. It would also be great for the mix-it-up plugin - as well as many other plugins i'm sure
