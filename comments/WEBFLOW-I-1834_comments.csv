14/04/2023,Chaupi Molino,@UXFLOW do you have a code for the sol√±ution you built?
02/02/2023,Yulee Li,I have the same problem I am working with B2B business and most of the payments are processed through invoices. I don't need Webflow to create invoices but to process and send an order to the office without payment. or COD. Nothing complex.
15/03/2022,Louis Riviere,Omg we need it so much !!
07/03/2022,Robin Klaiss,Come on guys! Pleaseeeeee!
15/11/2021,Jannik Oberlies,Word. This is essential.
24/10/2021,UXFLOW,I did come up with a work around solution. We have put a couple sales through it now and it seems fine I created a new page with a form that is setup like the check out and I was able to have a section of the page populate with the cart items with totals using java script. When the customer submits the form the cart items and totals come through with the form results. After the customer gets the bank account details and an invoice  and we have our own email workflow on Active Campaign that replaces the web flow confirmation emails.Hope that helps. Again this is a workaround but it works with not disrupting the sales process.
25/08/2021,Huzaifa Arif,Webflow you just got a huge seed funding please utlize it to do some good for webflow.
18/08/2021,UXFLOW,I will now be working on developing a solution ourselves for this.
18/08/2021,UXFLOW,This is an absolute fundamental to eCommerce. How and why is this not a top priority??? There are few big holes in the ecommerce function for Webflow but this is a big one. If I knew this prior to starting on the project I don't think we would have gone with Webflow. I'm trying to bring over clients from Shopify to Webflow but I don't have a leg to stand on with out offline payment option getting around no account page is bad enough. I can seem to find an explanation on why this in not available either. Does anyone know why?
01/08/2021,BrandSpace Studio,And more reasoning to include After Pay $29 Billion:
16/06/2021,Torben Winter,Yeah what the f***...
06/05/2021,David Eggimann,This is so frustrating. I love the platform and its (design-)possibilities. But because this feature ist still missing I have to choose other platforms to setup ecommerce stores. I have a feeling that the implementation would be relatively simple after all. Dear webflow team can you explain us why this feature does not exist yet?
06/05/2021,Inez Li,I opted for webflow to create my first ecommerce as it looks really cool and different. It is'nt easy for me as I am a total beginner. Its pretty annoying when I approach the final stage and realize I could hardly customize the payment methods. Bank Transfer has been so common and preferable for years now. How webflow didn't realize that. There may be not enough votes for webflow to consider this wish list. There is a reason why this wish list is still going on after the first post two years ago. I don't want customers to abandon their cart just because of the limited payment options.
02/05/2021,Master Sajangnim,Most SME's and big companies in the Philippines are using COD payment (like Shopee Lazada Shopify etc.).
27/04/2021,Gaming Stream,We had to stop with the E-commerce site and move to another platform because "simply" the payment platforms are not supported in our country neither in too many others
25/04/2021,Martin Volek,Been waiting for this more than year now... we need this!
08/04/2021,Berns Vitug,Shopify Weblium Duda..etc they all have this feature! I don't think it's hard to implement. It's a must-have if you're going to offer an Ecommerce solution. So please do implement this.... please
19/03/2021,Dominic Flepp,please please please make it possible to allow customers to pay upon arrival in the shop!!! it would be so easier for a small business to sell online! would me the world for me
13/02/2021,Squeqe,In which universe does it make sense to not have a Cash on Delivery payment method in 2021... Please implement this feature ASAP
31/12/2020,RJ Johnson,Also it would be nice to get/show responses from Webflow here rather than just have an open forum (a place where customers can complain/ask for things). Sometimes people just need to be reassured we're being listened to. I was somewhat amazed at how irate some responses are here. I'm not one to write in these type of things but my appreciation for what you're doing is strong and I want to see you succeed. It will help so many businesses that otherwise are limited. Therefore building stronger competition and a better experience for everyone consumers!
