05/12/2021,Matthew Beasley,Would love to be able to dynamically show my products from square on our websites homepage.
27/09/2021,Hemp Generation,We are a CBD business we use square and would love for it to be able to be integrated into websflow.
29/06/2021,Paul Ducco,Great to see the status of this updated to a "Reviewed" state ... curious to know though what the status change actually means.
23/08/2020,Karsten Koehn,That would be essential for the client that I'm helping out and would us make switch to ecommerce with webflow as we cannot use any other payement services unfortunatley and other tools that make us use square are quite buggy or slow.
19/02/2020,Phenotype Creative,Please please please do this!!
05/02/2020,Ben Dickens,How is this not happening yet??
05/02/2020,Joel Berggren,This would be so valuable. Right now there is no way to keep inventory synced between the Webflow store and the Square POS. I'm going to have to move ecommerce off of Webflow because of this for a client unfortunately.
30/01/2020,Megan Ruiz,Yes Please! I needed this integration yesterday. These other external integrations seem way to complicated. Is there anyone else using zappier or any other services to make this work? Can you tell me if it worked for you?
18/12/2019,Eric Wheatley,Square integration would be wonderful
22/10/2019,Othon Nin,I need it as well!1
08/08/2019,William Hancock,Yes please! Square payments and online stores are becoming more popular with my work.
17/06/2019,Paul Ducco,Yeah we have a retail customer who uses (and loves) the Square POS they have set up ... is there ANY way of getting webflow and Square talking?
23/04/2019,Adam LeDrew,Would love to have this I really like web flow for design but may have to switch if I cannot integrate an e-commerce platform
15/11/2018,Michael Urwin,Yes please! One of the things I do with my business is set u0 a square POS system and being able to integrate square into a payment system online would be amazingly seamless.
