03/12/2020,Kickass UX,Needs to be combined with: https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3376
10/11/2020,Tim Jones,This is website 101 stuff - this also has a huge amount of up votes - listen to the customers
09/10/2020,Steffi,Pleasssseee help us!!
06/10/2020,Uptwo Werbeagentur,Any updates?
22/09/2020,M Veltman,Webflow guys we need this please !
18/06/2020,Henrik Rommerud,This would be a time and ache saver!!
04/06/2020,Blå Design,@Dave Sloane If possible add GDPR to the title so this wish is easier to find.
03/06/2020,Simeon Zickert,When is it planed to integrate a feature like this?
26/05/2020,Garrett Reil,Hard to conceive of why this is not seen as essential. Not a pro platform without it.
23/04/2020,Johan Carlberger,I agree - I'm really looking forward to cookie management support for us EU users. It's a pain having to either pay for 3rd party solutions when it could be integrated directly into webflow or create the pop-ups myself.
02/04/2020,Nicolai Hemdrup,YES!
29/11/2019,Michael Tillmann,Any news on this or a statement from webflow staff?
28/10/2019,Matteo Grand,This is a no-brainer. Needs to be a feature.
07/08/2019,Roland Wolf,…would be great!
25/06/2019,Leonard Witteler,It's really surprising you don't have this yet.
12/05/2019,Valentin Steber,This would be a HUGE deal for customers in europe. Because all are afraid to get a fine for a wrong setup of cookies.
05/05/2019,Universal Music Austria,This needs to be addressed as soon as possible cause GDPR laws in Europe require this.
15/02/2019,Lino Lourenco,an absolute most we cant consider a tool like this without having the ability to put cookie scanning (whats on a site) and cookie management (turning off say analytics if its not wanted).
05/12/2018,Mag. Kurt Kaufmann,ASAP Please
