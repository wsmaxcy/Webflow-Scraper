08/04/2019,Adam Murray,Another vote for this especially now we have eCommerce linking a related product when you have 300 to choose from or similar with blog entries is now becoming painful. I would use a mutli-reference field but the CMS linking in the designer stops my ability to access related information if I use a multi-reference. Happy to share a link via DM if anyone is interested in seeing this issue.
15/05/2018,Matthew P Munger,Exactly! I have hundreds of items to scroll through. In my mind this should function just like a multi-ref in the CMS except that you're limited to adding a single item. No reason for two different UIs.
14/02/2018,Hamish Maclean,This is quite nasty as it is. There is major likelihood of duplicate references being created.
