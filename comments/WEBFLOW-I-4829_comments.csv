28/10/2022,Tea Kuseva,Yes please! We desperately need this too! We have an online ticket store and basically people cannot add the event attendee name anywhere because we cannot add even "First" / "Last Name" field options. Billing details are very often different because companies pay for their employees' event attendance.
09/05/2022,Brad Pickett,Why can't webflow just give us the options like it's a form! I need this too!
16/03/2022,Brown Bag Laundry,I have the same issue too. I hope this will work.
