11/02/2023,Jason Newlan,This would be amazing. This is exactly what i need!
16/03/2022,Justin John,yes this would be great. For example buying a piece of art with option to have framed or not framed. Currently I have to create the options and if one sells it leaves the other with inventory and I have to manually change it. Unless I've overlooked a way to do this which is entirely possible.
25/11/2020,Matan Assulin,Its 2020 Is this basic feature still not available because I am having trouble with product add ons for a restaurant online menu. If anyone knows any work aroundsplease update me!
