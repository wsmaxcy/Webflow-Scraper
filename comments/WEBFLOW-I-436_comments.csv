10/01/2019,CSS Ninja,EXACTLY! Importing and exporting in BootstrapÂ v4.2.1 would make Webflow probably the most competitive platform on the planet .. it's fine to have Bootstrap templates but what good are they if there is no integrated CMS? Add a Bootstrap (and Foundation) version of Webflow and this platform will rock.
27/01/2018,Sanbron Liong,It would be awesome! Designer and Developer WIN-WIN
16/12/2017,Yaroslav Glodov,Awesome feature which webflow MUST HAVE.
13/12/2017,Creative Team,This would open up a whole swathe of options for us and our processes.
26/10/2017,Victor Goutay,It'll be great if you could export the code with bootstrap-grid classes. The code would be definitely more maintainable.
07/04/2017,Rhami Aboud,Yes! That would be the ultimate feature
