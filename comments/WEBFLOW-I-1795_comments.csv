10/02/2023,Stefan Weber,needs to be resolved. There is a world outside of the US and English speaking markets....
04/10/2022,John Matias,Adding another vote for this to be resolved.
14/09/2022,Drains to Ocean,It's now 2022 and apparently they havent fixed this? Did anyone get a workaround to it? I just launched my new non profits website and will not announce its live until this gets fixed. Thanks!
16/08/2022,Elizabeth Gunter,There needs to be a single line that says Sales tax. This is the sort of problem that will make my clients pull the plug. I'm holding off on building any more ecommerce store on this platform beacuse of it and its such a shame.
26/05/2022,Alexis Kraus,Grrr... I was wondering why people in one city weren't buying our products. Now I know why: Because Webflow is requiring that we show taxes that don't apply to the buyer. This is NOT STANDARD ECOMMERCE taxation practice ! My client wants me to move to Shopify and I really don't want to have to do that but I may not have a choice now until this 4 year old known bug is resolved by Webflow.
14/05/2021,Yadira Ohlrogge,The buyer should only see one line that says "Sales Tax". This is what happens when you let accountants do the UX. Design a feature that allows you to combine the three or more taxes to one line. Only the seller should see the breakdown. If maybe you want the buyer to have the option to view the breakdown of taxes afterwards fine but that can be an entirely different option that you can provide the buyer with but not readily viewable. My customers will right away feel like they're being nickeled and dime to death and bail. Something will not feel right to them because we are just not used to seeing this. This is not standard practice when we purchase stuff online.

10/12/2020,Julian Galluzzo,why can we not just write our own tax formula??
28/09/2020,Pattterns,This is a MUST if your page is not in english. We need this ASAP!
30/06/2020,Jane Fennessy,Urgh! This is the kind of thing that will make my client pull the plug! Come on WebFlow!!

26/04/2020,Rithvik Gujjula,Combine all taxes into one which is a standard practice similar to Amazon. Need this feature ASAP.
24/04/2020,Emil Villumsen,Very Wordpress'y hope they fix it ASAP
20/04/2020,Neil Newnham,How has this not got more votes? It's baffling how this is not an option.

12/08/2019,Nick Bohlen,Yes! It's a Must have. In Germany we need it to be called "Inklusive MwSt. (19%)"
01/03/2019,Hamish Maclean,Yes. I need taxes to be GST
