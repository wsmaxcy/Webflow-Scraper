21/06/2023,Linda Kim,Please Increase!
06/06/2023,Alexander Engl,Why is this even a limitation? seams weird...
08/05/2023,Jeff Berube,Can we please get an update on this? This is sorely needed. If you can't do it at least explain to us why.
19/04/2023,Aaron Byrum,It's baffling that this hasn't been solved yet. Why build out logic when this is in my opinion much more needed. These limitations are debilitating.
10/04/2023,Adriano Resende,It's possible this is taking so long because Webflow's schema doesn't support arrays/lists so they'd have to make fundamental data model changes. [2]
03/03/2023,Hari Prasath,This is incredibly limiting. I really hoped after these many years of complaining Webflow would have gotten to this by this point.
28/02/2023,Davi Nunes,NESTED COLLECTIONS ARE ALMOST USELESS WITHOUT THIS
12/02/2023,Mario P.,To have more than one collection item is a must.
02/02/2023,Илья,Will you give some kind of answer to this request?
01/02/2023,David Wood,Need this feature badly. Please add ASAP and lift the 5-item limit on the current nested collection.
30/01/2023,Hovhannes Sahakyan,Super important think to scale product
26/01/2023,Rheed MacPherson,Any timeline on this?
15/01/2023,David Navratil,One of the worst limitations in working with CMS.
11/01/2023,Daniel Garcia Paris,Please this is a must.
11/01/2023,Tyler Mills,It's possible this is taking so long because Webflow's schema doesn't support arrays/lists so they'd have to make fundamental data model changes.
11/01/2023,Tyler Mills,This seems like core functionality...
04/01/2023,Sébastien Plisson,This is really needed to build robust magazine / blog layout
02/01/2023,Daniel Graaf,@Webflow is there any update on this? What's going on.
15/12/2022,Josh Coleman,I guess we're just yelling at the sky now but I also have this problem. Very limiting and concerning that there's no official response here after years.
22/11/2022,JasonW,Need this for really any more dynamic site without having to do janky workarounds
