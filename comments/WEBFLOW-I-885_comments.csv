27/11/2022,James,Yessss - please introduce global animations. I'm tired of having to apply Page Scrolled interactions to each individual page on my site.
04/02/2022,Kwame B,This would be a game change. Particularly global interactions!
26/07/2021,Mark Moss,I'd love for this to be added! I have a page scrolled up/down interaction to adjust the menu size & contents. I currently have to manually add the interaction to each page. A checkbox to make it 'global' would save me so much time.
