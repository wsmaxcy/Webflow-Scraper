08/02/2023,Frankh,Yes this is really needed.
12/09/2022,Kasan Mantel,Yes please fix this. It makes absolutely no sense why this does not work. Multireference is cool. But without sorting possibility somehow very unusable.
26/06/2022,Lorin Atzberger,It's fascinating how this is still not a thing 5 years later. With this rate of improvement I'd expect a better competitor any day now.. it's not like the bar is even slightly high.
02/06/2022,Cord London,If Timothy Ricks has voted for this we NEED this asap!
23/05/2022,Daniel Castro Maia,so basic
14/02/2022,Athens Orthopedic Clinic,sorting in the field would be great. But I'd be just as happy if we could sort them like any other CMS collection list.
18/07/2021,Ethan Feuerbach,yes need it for my shows season. Why it can't be sorted IDK.
02/10/2020,Milan Balogh,None of those this is for when you have a MULTI-REFERENCE field and they appear like tags when you edit them. there is no option to reorder them ALSO! there is no sort order when you are showing these fields on the website. The second would be better. why don't we have a sort order for them like I'm showing related articles as multi reference items and then I'd want to sort them by date published. Not possible.
28/07/2020,Timothy Ricks,With our WordPress sites the clients are accustomed to being able to build their own pages from the front end by dragging and adding pre-designed modules in any order on the page and filling them with content. The same can be achieved with Webflow by using the multi-reference field. The only part that's missing is the ability to actually drag to reorder those multi-reference items without having to delete and re-add them in the correct order. This one definitely gets my vote because once this is added the potential is unlimited.
15/06/2020,Gareth Higham,Yes please to this

19/06/2019,Brian Harstine,yes needed!! - has this feature been enabled yet? re-ordering CMS entries for a portfolio style page would be killer
15/05/2019,Glenn Eastland,Essential and a regular feature in WordPress order by menu_order
12/05/2017,Odie Partners,This would allow us to create a much easier image gallery workaround as well by allow us to multi-ref link to a collection of images and control their order of display.
12/05/2017,Diarmuid Sexton,Hi Sergie
12/05/2017,Webflow Team,Is this for reordering collections in the collection panel or to create a specific order for collection items (https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-161 or https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-155)
