17/03/2023,Alex,Need This Asap!
22/02/2023,Nathan,What's the ETA on this one?
19/01/2023,Alex,SEO wise it's absolutely a must. Especially if you need to change it in multiple languages.
28/12/2022,Leo Stratus,It's wild to me that I can't change this. Extremely frustrating when I don't use the ecommerce functionality and want to use 'category' as the slug for my blog posts/articles.
19/12/2022,Anita T,This is absolutely critical for SEO. You say your product is designed for marketers but this is designed for brand managers not marketers. A digital marketer knows how critical this is to a business and this needs to be adjusted. Eg. some clients may need their url to be /service not /product.
08/10/2022,Jakub Kittler,This should be implemented ASAP
02/10/2022,James,What about multi-lingual websites? It needs to be done quickly!
02/10/2022,Alberto,Please do it!!
30/09/2022,Alex,Why can I change the collections urls but not the ecommerce ones? Kinda frustrating
30/09/2022,Giannino Trollino,Really important. Needs to be done
27/09/2022,Oliviero Taleghani,Extremely important for websites that are not in English. Required for SEO. Important for websites transfers. Very strange that you can modify without problems the CMS collections slugs but not the e-commerce ones.
28/08/2022,Niko Pajatsalo,This need to be done! It's 2022 and Webflow is growing with customers all over the world. We need this to improve SEO and UI etc!
20/04/2022,Joyjet Agency,100% required to enhance SEO.
14/12/2021,Rjukan Events,This is SUPERNECESARY!
10/09/2021,Tom Korth,Thats really needed!!!!The "old" URL of my client had a SEO ranking on number 1.To change the URL because im not able to edit the slug gave my client a huge decrease in his SEO ranking.... (even if I did 301 redirects of course) My client is mad afWould be awesome to have the ability to change that in the future.Or just even to use the "product" slug in my clients native language.
01/03/2021,James Bruce,Absolutely mind-blowing this isnt a feature. Have to do redirects on all existing shopify pages if we want to make the jump over to webflow.... As a result we are currently designing in webflow and thinking of using Udesly to code back into shopify. Booo.
23/03/2020,Just Imagine,100% yes please. Why would you do this?
09/12/2019,Daniel Blank,This is very important for SEO and for better UI experience.
