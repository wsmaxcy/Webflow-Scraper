03/09/2021,Rob Gale,Has this feature been implemented? I would love to see this as well part of what I love about webflow is the ability to try things and move things around easily but whenever it comes to dealing with assets it's like a huge bottleneck in my flow for me.
04/01/2021,Mickey Mercury,Would love to hear any news on this function - Thanks!
26/10/2020,Philippe Côté,Agreed! Even though Webflow marked Better Asset Management as Shipped I do believe that an option to Clean Up unused assets would be a very helpful time-saver.Apparently there is one workaround right now: if you duplicate your website Webflow purges the unused assets. A bit strange to go this length to achieve this.Let’s hope for a real update soon.
23/02/2020,A B,I spend far too much time uploading an entire asset registry when quite a few are unused as we update with current events consistently so photos are always changing. Can the "clean up styles" option be duplicated to also include "clean up assets"?
21/01/2020,Alex,Any news on this function?
