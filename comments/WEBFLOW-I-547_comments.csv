22/09/2022,Brent Hegnauer,Almost five years later here I am in support of this too.
31/05/2022,Ufuk Ã–zgen,Yes we need this please!
29/03/2022,Mission Driven Talent,Why isn't this being fixed?
05/02/2022,Nour Beiruti,Why isnt this being worked on
20/12/2021,Aury_Vietnam,it is really a pain not to have this option
29/08/2021,Andeh,*Continues ignoring for the next decade*
09/06/2021,Akshay Hallur,This is a long standing issue but rather a bug. They won't care to fix.
09/03/2021,Pontus Willebrand,Why is this still not available? As a designer I am counting on this to be a built in feature just like the "regular" CMS sort function.
29/08/2020,Joshua Woods,Yea i just ran into this problem loving the CMS features right now but i will have to have a way to get this working or will need to find a work-around.
28/07/2020,Nate Ward,Webflow we need this bad. Like really bad.
17/07/2020,Rich Cleeve,PLEASE!!!
15/07/2020,Kurt Weiss,This is the no code issue for so many!
27/05/2020,Giles Holland,Even if I could rearrange the pills in the CMS editor that would be a manual workaround--that would take like an hour to implement as a temporary measure surely?
13/04/2020,Nikol' Moira,This has to happen! Why hasn't this happened yet :(
13/03/2020,Tye Newton,IMPORTANT:
10/11/2018,David Mkwambisi,I badly need this. Please implement this ASAP!!...I believe every webflow user (if they use it long enough) will need this feature at one point or another
10/05/2018,Tim Kelly,This is super critical for my website.
14/04/2018,Colin King,Looking for an improvement to this asap too :(
