27/02/2023,Gerard van Loggerenberg,Here is some numbers:
01/12/2022,Katherine Taylor,Come on Webflow!!! Please support a South African online payment gateway I absolutely love Webflow but not being able to integrate payfast or paygate or literally any other payment processing app in SA is incredibly frustrating! You have an amazing product and I'm convinced that South African designers would all rush to sign up if you just fixed this...
31/10/2022,Kiara Toich,please so many south africans are adopting webflow as their go to tool for website design!!
12/07/2022,Pete Cronje,It's mad that there's no support... 3 years and counting...
27/06/2022,Kiara Toich,Please please please bring this feature.... it would help alot. more and more south africans are wanting to use webflow. Udesly works ok but has some limitations..
29/05/2022,Sherwin Sampson,Guys please! We asked for this 2 years ago. What do we need to do to get a local gateway running. Please Webflow
17/02/2022,Dale Bowman,Please add payment gateway for South Africa!!!
05/02/2022,Antonio Jigsaw Janse van Rensburg,Stripe isn't here.I design build and launch a business. But now I need Stripe ATLAS?Clap Clap Webflow.Thanks for leaving us hanging for 2 years
02/07/2021,Jakes van Eeden,Desperately needed feature. Stripe is never coming here. Stripe Atlas is too expensive for the locals and no one in SA is going to buy in USD anyway using Atlas or PayPal. Clients don't want PayPal or Stripe and neither do their users. Just look at the stats.
02/07/2021,Njabulo Hlefana,Any word from the Webflow team??
07/04/2021,Jannie,Pretty please add Payfast/Paygate/OZOW/Yoko/Peach payment....anything local would be ACE!

15/01/2021,Quentin Viljoen,Please add payfast/paygate for South Afica.

26/10/2020,Michael Viljoen,Does anyone know if it is possible to integrate Payfast through the use of forms?
