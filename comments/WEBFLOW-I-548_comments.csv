14/02/2023,Edward Bentley,ÔªøI was not aware that Webflow hosting didn't allow custom emails or just emails. I thought all hosting plans allowed you to set up emails. Even though I love Webflow but one of my must is to be able to set up emails for my clients. This is a deal breaker for me.
09/04/2021,Thomas Wentzel,Every time I have to tell my clients that email is not included I feel ashamed
31/07/2020,Fabian Lichtenstein,A realy must have.
27/07/2020,Konrad von Bruchhausen,A must have for business!!!
20/04/2020,Craftengine,Meet the first email and newsletter Webflow template!
18/07/2019,Alain,It's a musthave!
15/07/2019,Daniel Abbay,I am very surprised¬†email hosting is not included. If you want to attract freelancers and small businesses to start using it you should include this feature. We are¬†trialing¬†Webflow after using Adobe catalyst for many years but this is a major let down. I did not want to use WordPress but it seems a better option as we stand.
08/07/2019,Russell Tice,Huge pitfall for most of my clients. Hopefully an integration is in the works.
12/06/2019,Jo√£o Santos,It's the only thing preventing me from start offering this service for my clients.Please consider adding this option to your hosting plans.

07/03/2019,Jaider Verhoeven,Please add email to Hosting.

05/02/2019,Juval Kuerzi,NEED THIS URGENTLY!!
13/10/2018,James Reyes,Love the platform but still is missing important basics
21/09/2018,Daniel Cobb,This has got be on their ‚Äòto do‚Äô list. I get asked every time if my client can have their own email with Webflow. Makes it complicated when it should be built in with hosting!!
07/09/2018,Matt,It's already hard enough to on-sell the expensive Webflow hosting fees without even considering that email needs to be hosted and managed elsewhere.
