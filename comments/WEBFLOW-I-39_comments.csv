29/03/2022,James Sugrue,I've spent the last couple of months testing Webflow myself and it has been great. I really hyped it up to my team to convince them to give it a try. Unfortunately Webflow is not practical at all for teams. No collaboration no change tracking to see what other people have done only weird conflicts and lost data.
29/03/2022,Eddy Martinez,The current language for "Core" and additional team members with Designer access is deceitfully unclear.  No where does it mention the inability for two members with Designer access to not be able to edit pages in the same project.
23/07/2021,Bryce Looze,This feature seems like it is an essential aspect of creating modern websites using Webflow. Its disapointing that services like Wix have had this feature standard on their subscriptions while it seems that Webflow has not found it worthwhile to invest the necessary resources.
14/07/2021,Benji Michalek,Very needed for our team especially when working with copy teams and design teams
30/06/2021,Nikos Drandakis,we bought team account and surprised we can't use it at the same time.
17/06/2021,Jake Kushner,This is also related to granular permissions per user https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1
15/06/2021,Tim Mac,This sadly is limiting webflow to small teams and companies. You could add this as an enterprise feature and make tons of $$. Sadly we are going to have to leave webflow if this is not added very soon. I would prefer a similar check out and merge with master flow that github uses.
03/06/2021,Stacey Christiansen,This feature would remove a major impediment for my team! Please hurry!
03/06/2021,Marketing Shippr,I'm agree... we just moved our project to the team plan and what a surprise ^ we can't use it at the same time !! Why do you make this feature ? It just changes nothing compared to the "solo" plan.
18/05/2021,CFY Engineering,@webflow:  when will the update be coming for allowing multiple desingers to work concurrently in the same project?
09/05/2021,Thomas,@Webflow: Is there anything planned regarding this? Thank you
30/03/2021,HelloVandejong,Even only allowing working on different pages would be a game changer [2]
02/03/2021,Design | TEAM23,Team plan without collaboration makes no sense!
14/02/2021,Jonathan Guyon,More than needed!
26/01/2021,Nic Brown,Adding my votes to this. It's such a problem for only one my team members to work in Designer on the same project. This is definitely a needed feature (allow for more than one user to "check" out individual pages in the same project so we can get more done more efficiently). It's a little absurd to expect only one person at a time to manage an entire project when there are so many different tasks different users could be doing simultaneously.
17/01/2021,Freeflo Studios,We're still here so eager for this feature!
18/11/2020,Dammon Burden,This is vital.
11/11/2020,Philipp Neuberger,Today this is a must have. Don't understand how a professional team should work together on a site. Additionally the transferring is really complicated and doesn't seem to work with active hosting. Meaning you have to take your SITE DOWN to let someone else make changes...
26/10/2020,Chadwick Simpson,This is the biggest drawback to webflow. After building projects in React and using a gitflow and even dealing with the dreaded merge conflicts I would much rather deal with them than to not being able to work on the same project as a team.
26/10/2020,Daniel Brian,This needs to be the highest priority!! I agree with the below comment 100%
