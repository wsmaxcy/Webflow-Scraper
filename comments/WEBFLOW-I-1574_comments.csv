05/12/2022,Zaccaria Di Giorgio,This is essential!

03/08/2022,Sébastien Geldof,Why is webflow not building out features for ecommerce? they're way too slow! we're all dying to move away from Shopify and other non-design friendly ecom platforms
10/12/2020,Erin Corsi,Does anyone have any info about whether progress has been made on this?
10/07/2020,Frost Frost,Webflow Team
20/08/2019,The Poppyfield Agency,Yep. I have a high volume ecommerce client that I can't migrate to Webflow until ecommerce features are more robust and up to industry standards. Which is a bummer because the CRO control that I have with Webflow is so much better than Shopify developing.
20/02/2019,Jean Delaleau,Yes something like https://apps.shopify.com/grouped-products is also vital to my business !
16/02/2019,Hamish Maclean,I think my requirement related to this. I need an optional addon to be added to the cart. But the add on is made up and has no stock.
17/12/2018,Gabriel Rice,This is one of two features that is preventing me from making the switch to Webflow from Woocommerce (the other being product variants).  Selling bundles is vital to my business's ability to attract new customers and until this is added to ecommerce I will not sign up for a paid subscription.
