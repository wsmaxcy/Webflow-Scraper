16/02/2020,Matthew Paczkowski,Is there an update to this? It seems that webflow created the ability to connect lightbox for ecommerce with multiple images but this doesn't work for non-ecommerce CMS templates.
25/01/2020,Yin Zhao,Hi all! I found a good workaround for this:
15/12/2019,Eric Orlando,This would be great and very helpful. Webflow will hopefully get up to speed on current tools and features needed by and desired by photographers and those who have sites with lots of images. Its a bit surprisingÂ how little Webflow does in the area of lightbox galleries filters of galleries etc...
23/05/2018,Peter Dimitrov,This willÂ definitely make work easierÂ ðŸ˜Š Right now I'm working on a wedding agency website and they have like 300 + photos. Wishing LOVE
01/02/2018,Eliot Murton,Being able to drag and drop a group of images into a lightbox compatible gallery would save soooooooooo much time!!!!
