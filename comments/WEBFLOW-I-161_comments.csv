08/01/2023,Himanshu Chawla,Hi everyone as Webflow team hasn't launched an official solution for this issue we have built a Webflow Collection Sorter Chrome extension! With this extension you can easily and quickly rearrange the order of your CMS collection items in Webflow using a simple drag and drop interface. Using the extension is pretty simple:- Install the extension- Add a "Sort Order" number field- Use the Sort button to launch the drag-and-drop interface to reorder the collection items.Extension link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webflow-collection-reorde/dgfmdefiehjbcnocbmjepgeichkociih/
04/01/2023,Sébastien Plisson,I just created a new post about this feature but not only. I'm talking about being able to create sections for the designer thatn clients can add remove or reorder in the editor
21/11/2022,Steven Maas,Bump we need this!
09/11/2022,Jeremy,Still very much needed!
28/08/2022,Petra Ouhrabkova,Please please please. We use CMS with practically every single business and this would be a huge time saver. Thank you!
17/08/2022,Cesar Lopez,I decided to add this comment because it's been over a month since someone else's plea and I just built another FAQ with only 12 questions and it's still a pain to customize the order of the list by using a number field. Thus I was reminded how desperately there needs to be an option to to customize the order of collection items. A manual drag-and-drop option would be ideal for most clients.
13/07/2022,Rafael Bergstrom,Please make this happen!!!! We're a small nonprofit and this has been a really big hinderance for efficiency in website edits for us.
13/07/2022,Jonas Cederholm,I can't believe this is still on the wishlist 5 years later. It really is a bad joke at this point. Sort by manually added numbers on each individual cms item you say? Yeah clients really love doing that. Give me a break ...
02/06/2022,Michael Hoang,Any updates on this?! So many of our clients are not enjoying the experience of sorting by numbers it get's too complicated and messy when managing CMS items.Can we get going with this drag funcationality please!
31/05/2022,Tyler Griffin,What has been holding this up for 5 years?
05/05/2022,David,This comes up on most projects I work on I can't believe this still isn't a thing.
05/05/2022,Alistair Williams,Super essential – pls add.

26/04/2022,Web LoveWell,Seriously guy.....hurry the freak up with this option.
19/04/2022,Pablo Sara,Yes please manual order is crucial in some cases.
15/03/2022,Susan MacPhee,This came up in a client call again today. What is the status?
22/02/2022,Jonathan Holden,It's been 5 years... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bcnO3VQ_fc

18/01/2022,Susan MacPhee,Very important to have this feature. In this case we are managing almost 100 FAQs and need to order them in a way that's contextual to members/users.
12/01/2022,Brian Punger,Such basic functionality should have been a feature since Webflow's Infancy
