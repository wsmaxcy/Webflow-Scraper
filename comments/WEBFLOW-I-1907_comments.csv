Webflow needs to create the same field matching function with e-commerce items as they have with CMS items and also add in abandoned cart email functionality and THEN they will be a competitor to Shopify. Also these should be really easy fixes! Come on Webflow I know you can do it!

30/09/2020,Smith Evans,I have a client asking about abandoned cart recovery just 10 minutes ago. We really need this feature in Webflow.
03/09/2020,Mack McConnell,Monto.io is about to release an Abandoned Cart Recovery app built for Webflow Ecommerce and much less expensive than existing alternatives. Shoot me a message if you'd like to be a part of our Free Beta starting next week!
28/05/2020,Josh Graef,Agreed. These are the deal-breakers for using Webflow for e-commerce.
