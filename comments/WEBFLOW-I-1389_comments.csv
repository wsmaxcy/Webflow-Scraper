21/11/2022,Andy Hoey,This is a must especially when using logic to add CMS items!
06/09/2022,Domanique,Any update on this?
16/06/2022,L√©on van de Klundert,I wouldn't call no change in 4 years progress.. Could you please either update the status or (preferably) get this feature into beta!?
31/01/2022,Alex Cheng,Update please?
24/06/2021,Martijn Runia,Also curious about an update on this. A new project is coming up that needs this feature.
12/04/2021,Jirka Kadlƒç√≠k,Any update @Webflow?
13/01/2021,Alex Cheng,After 2 years and still in development?
07/01/2021,Good Access,I also find it rather annoying not having form upload in the CMS package. My percieved value is about 1$/month for my use case and if it was add-on I would get it. It can't justify doubling the hosting cost for a client. I have to go searching for 3rd party solution with a bit bitter taste for webflow's pushy pricing policy ‚úåüèª
12/05/2020,Luca Gramaccini,As you are working on improving the form I hope you are also considering these improvements.
10/03/2020,Diarmuid Sexton,For those looking for a cheaper option than is currently available - this is a third party form handling service that works perfectly with file uploads - and a small bit of setup.
11/01/2020,Peter Dimitrov,Happy to see that this will be added!
07/01/2020,Andrea Garganico,1 year and a half to implement it? Come on Guys!
25/11/2019,Diarmuid Sexton,Any update on this Webflow?
01/10/2019,Jac Evans,Hi - is this still in development?
26/07/2019,Pierre-Jean Duval,Really need this as well for recruitment page of clients websites.
09/07/2019,Gabriel Mora,Please when will this feature be added? I really need this I'm overpaying for something I'm not even using just for be able to upload some files.
27/06/2019,Hamish Maclean,And multi attachment please
19/06/2019,Dan Toro,ETA?
