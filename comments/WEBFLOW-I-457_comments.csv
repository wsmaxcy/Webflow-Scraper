02/03/2017,John Smith,We need to be careful with this. The point of Webflow is to make it easy for you to create anything you need. This is different from having basic widgets to drag and drop just like the regular web site builders. Webflow is a tool for professionals and as such it is aimed to offer wide scope of possibilities. Therefore we should have only widgets which are not possible or very difficult to create ourselves. Otherwise we could end up with a lot of bloat.
