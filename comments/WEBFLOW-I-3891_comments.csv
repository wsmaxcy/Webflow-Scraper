17/05/2022,Alan Alston,It would also nice to easily add captions while doing this. Add a toggle on the 'Other Images' grid view to switch them all to list view. In list view one would now be able to easily edit the alt text and even copy a link to the image to embed it (and associated alt text) somewhere else in the site.
09/07/2021,Ivan I,Can't express enough how much this lack of a feature is a deal breaker...and a major disappointment at how long it's taking to implement. As an art instructor that works with students and artists building artist portfolio websites there's simply no way to use Webflow since we can't add image descriptions and information.
