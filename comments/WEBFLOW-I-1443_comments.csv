14/09/2018,Webflow Team,When it comes to building out new static pages you may not want to give full control over to your clients. Each new page may require some art direction.  If you give full design control over to your clients and they don't understand basic web design and graphic design fundamentals the look of the site may not be as cohesive as the other pages that were originally designed.
