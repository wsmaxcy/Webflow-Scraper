18/09/2017,Martin Seifert,I am sure many of you have been there - you design a main navigation with a page like products that of course has descriptions of various products. But: when navigating to one of the sub-pages in the products section you will lose the ‘current’ setting for you main navigation as you can only link the ‘current’ to one page. But for the sake of an understandable UX we would want to have the top navigation continue highlighting the products menu entry even if the user visits a sub-page!
