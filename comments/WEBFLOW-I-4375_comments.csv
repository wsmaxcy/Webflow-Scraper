24/06/2022,David Shantz,Color options have to be the MOST common of any product variants and the one that needs a visual button. Having a description or name ("Sunshine Yellow") for a color is like dancing about architecture...  This should be a no-brainer as it must be easy to implement and gets Webflow a step closer to being a professional-grade solution for e-commerce. (PS. we really need log-ins with accounts FFS).   Consider that with THIS there is the prospect that perhaps those template-loving-fairies at Shopify will be laughing a little less jolly come next Christmas...
