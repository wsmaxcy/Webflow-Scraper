27/04/2020,Paul Seymour,As a designer with an actual degree in design... yeah... I can't believe I have to manually insert real quotes. I guess it's helping my muscle memory to do it manually though. But for some typefaces it's really hard at small sizes to see if I'm getting the opening/closing marks right. So yeah... this should just be there.
