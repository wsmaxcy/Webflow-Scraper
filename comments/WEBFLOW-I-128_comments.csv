23/06/2023,Ulysse Debouny,2017 this is long overdue Webflow!
15/06/2023,Rafael De Guglielmo,Comon Webflow!!! is Just a checkbox to let the user pay in cash... or manually. and an email template for instructions in config.
31/05/2023,Zsolt Balogh,I was just about to pay then I realized that there is no PayPal payment option. Really dissapointing.
27/04/2023,HelpDesk,Please add Paypal and / or PAD payments.Alot of SMB would like to use PAD rather than a Card.
27/04/2023,Pascal Perrochon,please add Paypal so EU clients donâ€™t have to support added bank fees thanks!
15/04/2023,A Z.,Please add paypal. It would be such a gamechanger.
27/03/2023,Anonymous User,Here is how to easily accept Giropay on Webflow with Stripe Payment Links.https://youtu.be/MvSaxb5aFX4
24/03/2023,Donita Massing,It would remove barriers to secondary education entry if Webflow had a special education portal that didn't require a credit card.
28/02/2023,Franco Sponchiado,Wire + Money transfer are necessary
06/02/2023,Dominic Bilke,PayPal is absolutely necessary for a modern company.
03/02/2023,Tobias,I can't believe a company as big and internationally accessed as Webflow has just 1 payment option
20/12/2022,Shivadas De Schrijver,At least paypal if not bank transfers as well should be possible! Some countries don't rely as heavily on CCs as the US and definitely Paypal is helping with that..!
09/12/2022,Mel Wes,Would love to use Webflow but unfortunately have to look for an other option since there are no paypal or bank transfer billing payment methods. These kind of methods are obviously needed (especially in countries where many people don't use Credit Cards)
04/12/2022,Bankano Bankano,BITCOIN payment should be a standard in these type of platforms.
29/11/2022,Phillip,eCommerce makes no sense here in Switzerland without option for bank transfer or mobile paying with TWINT. Please add this.
17/11/2022,Stefan,Absolutely necessary! Webflow's solution is US-Centric. As many others wrote below Europe / Asia has a plenthora of other payment solutions that are not credit card based... (direct debit / mobile payments etc.)
12/10/2022,E2E Networks Limited,This is very important for Indian customers who are unable to pay via any credit or debit card because of RBI guidelines.
30/09/2022,Szymon Szczechowicz,In Poland the use of payments in e-commerce Webflow is completely non-functional. I'd like to pay an ecommerce subscription but that doesn't make sense.
26/09/2022,Antanas Pundzius,Our school may abandon webflow site in the absence of a bank transfer option...
24/09/2022,Omar Assem,direct payment with credit cards master visa and american express and then wire the money to my bank account  so anyone around the world can pay stripe and paypal are great but it's really limiting.
