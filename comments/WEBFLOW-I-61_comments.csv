17/02/2022,Matt Rogers,Another example of something that is standard in other CMS' that Webflow is competing against but Webflow has yet to implement.
08/10/2021,Michael David,YES! THIS. Unfortunately for anything other than a basic site I'll continue to use Craft CMS for this reason. It's one of the only things holding me back from fully embracing the Webflow CMS on many client sites. PLEASE give us the Matrix field equivalent!
13/08/2020,Timothy Ricks,A workaround way to do this is drop in a Collection List. Each of the collection items should be Page Sections so the client can add them in whatever order they want. Then you add a dropdown in the Sections CMS where the client can select what type of section they want to add to the page (Image + Heading + Button Full-Width Video Three Column Section etc.). Once the client selects one of the predesigned layouts for that section item you use conditional visibility to reveal that design within the section item. Here’s a quick tutorial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxx4JqmGbV0
02/08/2019,Jose Ocando,This would be amazing. Right now I'm building a landing page collection. I want to have various page blocks the client can insert. I'm using conditional visibility to let the client choose which blocks show up. But it would be better if they could add a block from a pre-existing list and only the content fields for that block appear. That way there's not a bunch of extraneous fields.
21/07/2019,Ankit Saini,What a wonderful blog and provide very credential information roblox robux free. I just want to say thanks for this online support here quickly.
04/07/2019,Allan Miles,Use case for me is being able to push events created in the Webflow CMS to a Google calendar. google street view It seems that WF could have a trigger in Zapier for "New CMS item" and "Updated CMS item." There's so much we could do with this!
19/01/2018,Rike Catalani,This will become essential. Being able to create "section templates" will allow editors extra freedom to create more and will ease the designers work load. It got to be optional of course so we can prevent the careless editor to break the website.
11/10/2017,Malte Michels,That's a must have for a modern CMS. Wondered when I didn't find the opportunity of a Matrix Field. Is there any way this time to give the content creator the opportunity to reorder different content blocks?
16/03/2017,AJ Griem,This is a really important feature and I'm surprised it doesn't have more votes (18 as of this writing). I want to switch away from Craft but matrix fields really allow me to have complete control over the design while the client has complete control over the content.
08/02/2017,John Moore Williams,Been on my personal wishlist since we launched the CMS :)
04/02/2017,Dmitry Ratnikov,Must have lets beat Wordpress!!
19/01/2017,Per Kristian Grindheim,Thought of the same thing. This would make give more flexibility for the customers of more advanced news-driven sites or product pages with individual layout wich suits the specific product. Maybe something like the Weebly builder on steroids?  https://www.weebly.com/features/website-builder
