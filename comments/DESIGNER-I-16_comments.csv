18/04/2023,Shubham Jindal,How is it 7 years since this was posted and still no ability to add a table? Tables are super useful for showing information and having it indexed by Google for SEO. Please enable this asap.
29/03/2023,Kimberlee Alley,What is happening with this feature? It can't be that hard to build (says a non-engineer)?
15/03/2023,Leigh McDonald,Honestly they don't need much for this feature as an MVP and they're overthinking it from looking at the survey they posted above.
01/03/2023,Harry,pls
01/03/2023,Nicolas von Rosen,So 2.5 years for the admins to ask what users really need here and another 4 years since this and still nothing has happened?
27/02/2023,CloudSEK Info,No update here it seems. We need this badly.
23/02/2023,Leigh McDonald,
23/02/2023,Kim Vigsbo,What is the hold-up? The table structure is an essential page element and should have been implemented years ago!
14/02/2023,Robert O'Neill,When was the last update on this?
12/02/2023,Amul Patel,shocked to learn that webflow doesnt have this BASIC critical element.

23/01/2023,Matt Frappier,I’m here in 2023 to beg Webflow to add this. We need a table in CMS collections that can also be added as a normal element and can use dynamic repeater field data. If Wordpress has had this for nearly decades it’s crazy Webflow doesn’t have it. Especially considering that the table element is literally one of the first lines of HTML code you learn in coding 101 classes.
27/12/2022,Joe Friberg,I'm newly inducted into Webflow and love the overall functionality but like the thousands who've spoken before me it's inexplicable that there is no basic table function.
05/10/2022,Travis Steinke,Webflow please make this a priority.. 1600+ votes for a simple feature.
27/09/2022,Kelly Knowles,I've been singing Webflow's praises for years and I was excited to move my UX team's design system documentation off of Zeroheight and onto Webflow.
06/09/2022,Daniel,Webflow is an amazing product but upvote this if you think tables need to happen!
29/08/2022,Scott Lewis,Has a table feature been added? I can't find any info other than this wish list. I would love to see a table that can pull from a CMS collection such that one CMS item = one .csv file with multiple columns and rows (vs. having each row be a separate CMS item). This way my client can manage publishing the data.
