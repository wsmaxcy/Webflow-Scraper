21/08/2022,Jon Cox,Also note that major websites like twitter.com support this. It has very much become an indicator of a quality made website (which is what Webflow is all about!).
21/08/2022,Jon Cox,As well as Dark Mode colours it would also be very useful to have an option to set a Dark Mode version of images (but have it default to the Light Mode version if none is set).
08/03/2022,Fatheen Nizam,Please add this! You can do it Webflow!
19/05/2021,Aleksandr Pasevin,Bump. This is becoming an issue...
23/01/2021,Oliver Krause,This would be so awesome to have!
14/01/2021,Michael Gubik,Coming from code but loving Webflow so far I gotta say that this is the first major downer I occur. I hope this will be fixed soon.
29/11/2020,Can Olcer,This would be great to have with more and more users surfing around in dark mode.
05/07/2020,Gary Colwell,This would be so next level. Please develop this Webflow!
08/06/2020,Sophie Zhao,Please prioritize this webflow!! Really need this!
30/05/2020,Erin Keeffe,Would love to see this supported. I'm imagining a toggle at the top of the styles panel that could switch between your light & dark css properties as as example.
06/03/2020,Damir,Would be ace to have this! Please prioritise Webflow.
30/09/2019,Iskandar Bwefar,Great! Love to use this on our website.
