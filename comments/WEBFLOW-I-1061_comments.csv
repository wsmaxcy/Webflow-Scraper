04/05/2023,Miles Mitchell,Gahhh this would be awesome and so helpful for clients to keep your designs working as intended.
01/12/2022,BC Technologies,5 years since first requested - basic functionality still not implemented.
27/05/2022,Tuomas Pitk√§nen,This would be great!
21/09/2021,Julie Lim,Hopefully they're working on this because this would be suuuuper helpful
21/04/2021,Josh,Would love to see this implemented!
01/03/2021,Szymon Zurek,This would be great! I really need this for Zapier integrations too. This way I would be able to label different forms accordingly as some Zaps don't allow to just use the form ID as the label.
08/02/2021,Julien V.,Useful for CMS collections populated with Zapier with multi-reference fields
10/10/2020,Verve Light,This would be super useful especially when adding a new field to an already established CMS table.
