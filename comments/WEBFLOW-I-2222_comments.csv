02/09/2022,Alice Holm,Please add local language to your editor/designer ui. I most likely have to switch to Wix Editor X because they have Norwegian UI for my clients to understand. Not all are good in English especially older people.

03/07/2021,Alan Kemsley,I am very attracted to Wix’s features right now and I am considering switching. The only reason I haven’t switched yet is because they require you to host several client projects with them before they even give you access to the most basic client tools such as direct client billing and white-labeling (how am I supposed to bill the first few clients???).
