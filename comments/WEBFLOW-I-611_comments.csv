14/12/2021,Dusty Strings,Importing a site with a lot of inline text links to specific CMS items and it's worrisome to have to copy and paste in a static URL. It would be great if an inline word in a Rich Text field could be dynamically linked to a specific CMS item.
13/09/2020,Martin B,Another very basic oversight when it comes to the Webflow CMS. Unfortunately the platform is littered with frustrating little limitations like this which push users towards dysfunctional workflows with messy workarounds.
29/05/2020,Andrew Johnson,Please for the love of GAWD make this happen!
17/05/2020,Tim Dawson,FIX THIS!!!!
14/03/2020,Tye Newton,Hey guys hasn't this been implemented? I somehow missed it at first and came here when searching for answers but then I noticed the second option for a link is "collection page."
26/06/2019,Click Click,Must be thanks for the amazing post here it is the very nice remember password edge all function here to secure data base.
27/02/2019,Matt Hodkinson,^ Please ignore my above comment - I've worked it out
27/02/2019,Matt Hodkinson,I'm shocked that this is on a wishlist. I assumed that it would be standard functionality
28/11/2018,Phil Jeyes,This facility really should have been added by now. I'm disappointed to see it hasn't
14/09/2018,Grant Dullage,This is so stupid how is this not sorted!!
18/06/2018,Koen Spaansen,Yeah similar to link-to-page options Sergie! Would be perfect! Good idea Sean!
30/05/2018,Alex Mair,FWIW I worked around this by creating a collection list with a link bound to the target collection and set a filter to something unique about the collection I wanted to target (e.g. the name!)
12/05/2017,Webflow Team,So similar to the link-to-page options that are available when setting a link in a rich text?
