02/06/2023,Kyle Palermo,For developers coming into Webflow the lack of really basic css selector control is a huge turn off. If you want more adoption at some point you're going to have to open up the platform to modern css. I think this would be a hell of a lot more useful for developers than a React integration :)
14/05/2023,Stof Hofer,Yes please the current combo classes are kinda getting less useful the more you actually try to use them.
12/05/2023,Wouter van Waning,The lack of this feature makes every Webflow project so needlessly more bloated and messy to work with. Fundamental CSS logic missing for what it seams no reason at all.... Love the way you describe this Brendan even though the fact that you wrote this has been 6 years ago...
08/04/2023,Mehnz,sometimes I'd like to just say Go that thing yourself just a few world class developer away to graphql your entire infastructure while you go keep hiring new dmos cmos ufos.  ...you realize at your pace webflow will never run parallel with the cutting edge? nvm all the 2603 voters from 2017 to present... all are doing fine just that weird taste you've left us thinking the love was mutual.
24/03/2023,Alex Bass,This please I know I'm making SUCH a mess with CSS classes because of how Webflow handles it by default ðŸ˜©
06/05/2022,Corgi Bradbury,Adding my vote. Symbols have nothing to do with this---I want to be able to target all elements of a specific kind inside a given class. The fact this functionality already exists within Webflow (as noted below by Michael David) but can only be used if you hack around it is nothing short of bizarre.
31/12/2021,Parcion,Please give us the ability to more easily manage and work with our css. This has nothing to do with symbols so the admin response is not applicable. We need the ability to be able to convert combo classes into a new singular class and the ability to use more global classes. I like the combo class idea but it is running wild and needs to be tamed LOL.
25/11/2021,Lonnie Kuhn,In CSS pattern matching rules determine which style rules apply to elements in the ... CSS gives so much power to the "class" attribute that authors could
18/10/2021,Derek Adams,the column combinator; the :drop() pseudo-class ... querySelectorAll() function defined in [DOM] or the selector of a CSS style rule.
19/07/2021,Mike Escoffery,What is with the Admin Response?
27/02/2021,Nicole Cmar,Pleeassse Webflow give us this! I'm still getting used to Webflow and have some SCSS knowledge and the combo classes make no sense. Sometimes I search for several minutes just to figure out the inheritance meanwhile if I had a global class it would be so easy to edit. Symbols don't help on this part because there's still so so many classes. Improvements are definitely needed!
14/02/2021,Tom Rauscher,I'm disappointed by this response. The inheritance dropdown that let's you switch between combo classes and device rules is like... 95% of the functionality here... Why not just let us select the specific class in this dropdown? In my screenshot I've got a Column class and a combo class for a Column with padding. If I could just select the Padding class in this dropdown I would literally have a utility class I could use everywhere for even padding without even thinking about it. It would speed us up so much.
28/01/2021,Michael David,There is already the ability to create descendant selectors in the rich text element so the UI and functionality exists. This functionality should be expanded so that it can be applied anywhere â€“Â so that any class can be applied on the condition of it being nested in the selected parent element.You can even hack the RTE nested selector functionality to do this elsewhere as described here: https://forum.webflow.com/t/how-to-define-css-descendant-selectors-in-webflow/135561
21/01/2021,Giles Holland,In response to the admin response of 19 Jan 2021: That isn't going to help. Symbols and utility classes are fundamentally different things. Nothing you can do to expand symbols is going to cover this gap. I have never seen a company ignore user feedback and engender as much user frustration as Webflow does. Whether it's critical feature requests voted by thousands of users or countless bugs reported years ago. You're alive for now because there's nothing nearly as good out there but it won't stay that way forever. This is an unsustainable philosophy.
21/01/2021,Tom Binroth,I don't know why Webflow ignores this feature request. Child selectors are an essential part in CSS styling. I need to style paragraphs and headlines in multiple sections. Styling a lot of text is a pain and time consuming process in Webflow.
19/01/2021,Alexander Wong,@Admin Response
28/12/2020,Mark Drake,I have a list. I give the UL element a class. I want to style every LI child element with this relationship - I shouldn't need to create another class and assign it to every child element (or expect my client to always remember to assign the class).
23/09/2020,Mandy Hopp,This is critical in making clean reusable code. The way it's set up right now is incredibly hard to keep track of.
13/08/2020,Tom Binroth,I am really missing support for bested "children of" styles. Any progress?
10/08/2020,Jullie Verma,Thanks for any other informative blog. Where else could I be getting that type of info written in such an ideal manner?
