22/06/2023,Graham Jones,I really do not understand this all the amazing things Webflow is coming out with yet there is still no CMS slider! It's unbelievable the workarounds you have to apply to get this working is quite frankly absurd! Clients just do not believe me when I say that Webflow does not do a CMS slider I mean come on Webflow a CMS slider surely it cannot be that hard to do it is an absolute basic requirement that huge numbers of clients expect.
04/05/2023,Miles Mitchell,Reviewed andddddd? ...raised prices üëç great that's fair
27/03/2023,Duetto Marketing,yes essential. the possiblity to drag and drop the items of a cms in the way you want them to be ordered
23/03/2023,Bar Rosenfeld,ÔªøEssential!
16/03/2023,Martin Geyer,Yes please
10/02/2023,Kevin Bryniak,You can use Finsweet's plugin for this. Only works on paid plans though because of custom code requirements.

27/01/2023,Susan Rainey,Please.
26/01/2023,Maarten van Willigen,Essential
11/01/2023,Jeanne Cassiers,how is this not a thing why are they raising prices yet not giving us literally basic stuff wordpress offers like CMS sliders and filter. baffling. having a harder and harder time selling these prices to my clients.

16/11/2022,Remi Eris,Looking forward to this feature being added asap... over to you Webflow!
06/11/2022,Jeffrey Karnes,This is sooooo needed. Shocked that this isn't in vanilla webflow. I love webflow and I am an evangelist for it but this and image gallery support have really let me down. Competitors do this well and it's hard to believe this has been on the wishlist for over 5 years.
28/10/2022,Maks Eidelson,Sooner the better...
28/10/2022,Alex Pedroza,A much needed feature. No-brainer if you ask me! Fingers crossed..
27/10/2022,Stay Company,Please add this feature we need it!!
