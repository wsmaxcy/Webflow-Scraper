26/05/2021,Steve Bayer,Try this web hosting service https://sitechecker.pro/website-down/ Much more reliable and cheap. This will help you to check your website availabilty within a short period of time.
05/01/2021,Jhonci Alex,Eevry business need the website for the marketing. First they buy a domain and then make websites on it. I saw a website of eric's car care that was very great all the services are manage properly.
20/07/2020,Paul Phoenix,We need a cheap CMS too. We have a budget project now https://essaywriters.site/best-dissertation-writer and a little bit of money.
11/06/2020,Jayden John,You have to care about hosting on weekly basis and try to make backup for it as well. I worked with https://www.resumehelpaustralia.com/arielle-review/ where they teach us how we can about it always.
01/03/2020,Jane Stone,your website is very important for google our generation.
18/07/2019,Tyler Jensen,I would love to see some cheaper hosting options. $15 / month is just to much for small sites that get 25-100 visits a month. Something like a simple $5 plan for ultra low traffic sites would be amazing.
21/03/2017,Brennan Smith,I agree with you about the pricing it's not justifiable to my clients. I have recently started using Perch CMS to convert my Webflow designs to a CMS. It has been a breeze to convert over to Perch and I have a lot more control with my deigns. At $60 per license it's a no brainer.
17/02/2017,Roberto,CMS hosting is actually a little too expensive for individuals and for small companies. I know you have increased recently the prices and do not discuss your choices also because WebFlow is unique but a CMS hosting for individuals is actually too expensive. If it is possible to decrease some prices or insert new options at a lower price you will attract many more customers who currently can not afford an annual or monthly plan spending so much. Thank you.
