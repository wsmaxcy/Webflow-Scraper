20/11/2020,Christopher Francis,side of things? Like... what? Why? This seems like a terrible oversight that is about to give me a huge headache. Even if I have to pay for more the option would be bloody nice.
12/07/2020,Daren,Could we please have file upload for ecommerce. Something as basic as this should have been built into the ecommerce hosting platform as part of having this in the order confirmation and check out options. Why hasn't this happened already. Could this a gross oversight? It is a necessity. Please explain. Thanks
