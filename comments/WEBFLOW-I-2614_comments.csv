29/10/2021,Surendra Dhote,Agree. AMP is no more a standard now. No need to chase amp to get ranked over content.

17/01/2021,Guest,I think it's a really good idea but it takes time to implement. I recommend a good website for students where they will write you an essay. The site has been time-tested for a long time so this is just advice.
