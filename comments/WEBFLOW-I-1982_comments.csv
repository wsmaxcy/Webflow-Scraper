09/06/2023,Smriti Sundar,Really need this since most other services make it easy to password protect individual pages. CMS Collections are a god send but this work around would be fantastic.
21/04/2023,Luana,i really really need this
13/02/2023,Sarah McCaffrey,So need this or will have o have whole website rebuilt elsewhere. Any updates??
19/12/2022,Kiri Coles,I went through all of the 21 day portfolio course and then found out this isn’t possible. Think I will have to do a strange page redirect situation as a solve but this functionality seems like a no brainer.
19/12/2022,David,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
18/07/2022,Veronica Agne,i really cant continue using webflow without this
13/07/2022,Jonathon Rossi,Ah come on!! Make it a thing already!!
02/05/2022,Veronica Agne,please i need this so much
05/02/2022,Nazar Alsamarai,This will allow us to move so many of our projects over from Wordpress.
12/11/2021,Sunny Li,need this so so much especially since most of my pages are dynamic.
27/09/2021,Winston Struye,I think a lot of people would find this very useful and for some reason it doesn't seem that difficult since we already have password protect for individual pages.
29/07/2021,SH,We really need this. Why would you protect a whole CMS collection but not protect individual items?
02/07/2021,Rahul Choudhary,Bring it soon need it like anything because of NDAs
01/07/2021,Israel Ramirez,Does reviewed mean it's under consideration?
01/07/2021,Guest,Ooh status changed to reviewed! I’m excited!
03/06/2021,Sebastiaan Kramp,Will this ever be available?
02/06/2021,Gabriela Dzenutis,This would be terrific! This would be especially great for projects in portfolios where you are under an NDA and are not able to showcase your work to everyone.
28/05/2021,Kaitlyn Daleiden,Is there any update on if this on the roadmap?
14/04/2021,Luis Maroto,Please add this soon!
03/03/2021,Kyle Baughan,yes please... a high paying client is needing this... they are considering switching to another platform in the future if it's not available.
