05/01/2021,Branislav Perd√≠k,Hello. I thing configurator is must have for many websites and it is a shame that people is asking for it from 2019 and still dont have it.
26/10/2020,Crunch Creative,Yes I second the "toppings" or "add-ons" comment from Gonsalves Media.
26/10/2020,Gonsalves Media,This is an extremely important feature for restaurant e-commerce sites as there needs to be an option to add "toppings" or "add-ons" to a product.For example a pizza shop would need to be able to include a list of toppings like "peppers for $1" or "extra cheese for $1.50" onto the main Pizza product.
