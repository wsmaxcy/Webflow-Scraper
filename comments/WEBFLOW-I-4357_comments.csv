23/12/2022,André Mortari,hi any news about it? I’m having a lot of trouble with DOM size due the Lotties in my website. The performance on lighthouse is terrible.
23/09/2022,Kamil Tomczyk,This is a great idea! Please do it <3
07/07/2022,Vincent Gravel,This is much needed for larger lotties and would help those of us trying to use complex lotties in our projects.
02/07/2022,Eliska Nghiemova,Please that would significantly help. The larger lottie animations wouldn't lag so much on mobile webs etc.
07/02/2022,Ingal Prudente,Would really help !
