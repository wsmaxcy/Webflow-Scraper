01/01/2021,Sean Young,I also find this to be an incredibly useful feature!So for instance if creating a membership experience for your site visitors (Memberstack perhaps now hopefully native in the future?) then you could have some API signals send their membership information back into Webflow in a Member Collection list that we also reference this proposed Orders CMS. Then we could setup a dashboard for them via a CMS collection page & then include a CMS collection from the Orders CMS collection filtering for their Member reference.I would like to vote on this however I don't have any votes left for some reason haha.
