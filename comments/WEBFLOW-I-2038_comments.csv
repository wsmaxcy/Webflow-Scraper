15/06/2022,Guillaume MESNARD,Like many others before me I don't understand why a CMS that seeks to dethrone all the others does not allow uploading the WebP format... it's not comprehensible in 2022 (especially since it doesn't shouldn't be a big feature to add).
15/06/2022,Olivier Roth,We need this to optimize site speed...
