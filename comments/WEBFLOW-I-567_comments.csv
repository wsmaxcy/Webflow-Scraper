27/03/2021,Daniel El Agha,this would be a game changer!currently we have to figure out some complicated work-arounds for this...so it would be great to get this function soon! (:
20/01/2021,Nick Herasimenka,We need this!
26/06/2020,Jon So,Investing max votes on this. I'm spent so many hours trying to hack together subpar solutions like scrolling video using Lottie (HUGE files sizes!) and using the Background Video element in places that I don't want it to loop (or that I want to pause/play it on enter/exit viewport). Please Webflow please add this to IX2 (or 3?) as soon as you can!

29/03/2019,Saxon Rix,This would be great! I''ve found that on this site: https://unawheel.eu/
21/12/2018,Matthew Sanderson,I'm out of votes but would love to see this too – I've spent ages messing around with custom code in the past to achieve this sort of thing. Be great to have it built into interactions.
26/11/2018,Alejandro Serpas,waiting for this to happen!

19/03/2018,Alborz Heydaryan,I messed up the CSS of the website and managed to see how it's a separate file. here are the actual links for the videos used there:
19/03/2018,Alborz Heydaryan,I gave this 3 votes. I spent quite a big chunk of time trying to figure out how Apple did the animations. except I was looking at the new iMac Pro page. It turns out it's an MP4 video and they are scrubbing through the video based on scrolling. And the screen is actually a whole other MP4 video but they are adding the perspective in code! I'm amazed at the level of detail there!I do motion graphics and this would help me bring my website to a whole new level!
20/07/2017,Matt Iuliano,YESSSSS PLEASE!
23/03/2017,Jung Euiyoung,good idea!
