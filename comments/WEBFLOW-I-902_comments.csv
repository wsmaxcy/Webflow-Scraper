22/10/2021,Rainer Strauß,Please add it. That would be amazing!
03/04/2020,Karson Krieg,+3 on this. As with all of you my client is frustrated by needing to notify me when a photo isn't oriented correctly.
04/09/2019,Michael Hathaway,Agree. This is a major problem with one of my clients who uses iPhone for all their pictures.
05/07/2019,Rick Messer,+3 on this. I understand it's complex but editing image orientation is an expected feature for everyday consumers. This seems to be a bug in how webflow reads images in the first place. Can we fix this pretty please? I will have to hold off on turning my clients loose on the editor until this is fixed which is very inconvenient for me.
22/05/2019,Hiram,+3 votes for this. Using an image compressor tool sometimes strips the metadata (which includes orientation) and it's quite a pain to have to use other tools to re-set the orientation.
20/06/2018,Roxzanne Fox-Roberts,I quite agree - I currently have a very unhappy client as she could rotate and resize image in WIX but now has to do an additional time consuming step to use WF - she uses a lot of images.  I would actually add 6k votes!
27/09/2017,Brendan Laird,A workaround would be using a Rotation transform on the Z-axis.
