23/06/2023,Brennan Burch,This really should be a MASSIVE priority especially considering how AWS tanks hard a couple times a year and shuts users out for sometimes up to a week and we lose work in the process.
01/12/2022,Giuseppe Legrottaglie,It would be very useful to convert Webflow to Chrome Web App so that you can install it on Mac easily while keeping all Web features and extensions.
28/11/2022,DeAndre Holland,This can be good and bad; need to work in the browser to test websites but would love an app to make Webflow run more smoothly.
15/11/2022,Dhennis Lim,we need to work everywhere with internet or with out internet so application in laptop may come in hand. thanks webflow... I love webflow so muchüòâüòç
04/08/2022,Jeremiah Steninger,Gareth Higham makes a good point. At least say you will pass it along to the team.
22/06/2022,Mario P.,This would be great. Similar to the Adwords desktop editor. It's fast! You make changes on your desktop aplication and then push them online. This new editor will also eliminate the 100 page limit.
01/06/2022,Juan Carlzon,ok if count votes this is only third on the list of requests‚Ä¶ so how much are you actually prioritising features requests from users?
18/05/2022,AHMER ALI,
23/09/2021,Alicia Leroux,Create a desktop/offline version of Webflow to be used when traveling or with bad internet connections.
25/08/2021,Gareth Higham,Simply because; no one can work anywhere on webflow.
09/07/2021,Kieran Reid,Wow really why so many upvotes!? Disagree. Desktop app is not even needed not gonna help anyones workflow if anything it'll just slow down the Webflow product/dev team more software s**t to maintain update and OS's to support... There so many other (more important) functional platform and technical limitations on the Wishlist that are much higher priority than a desktop app IMHO.
21/01/2021,Felipe Echandi,Technical limitations? How does Figma have an offline app then?
19/01/2021,Damien Northmore,Curious Figma seems to have nailed the browser and desktop functionality... offline updates sync when connected. May be worth looking at how that's done. With such a large user base Webflow has it would no doubt be a hit!
19/01/2021,Colin Simmons,Appreciate the response and I too would rather have the functionality mentioned (browser-within-a-browser) than software downloads. Membership and other wishlist items are way more important to me!

10/01/2021,Alejandro Medina,it's time
13/12/2020,Atanas Malamov,Yes please! This will be very helpful while traveling especially flying!
29/10/2020,Boudjema Adjaoud,Je suis compl√®tement d'accord √áa serait vraiment tr√®s int√©ressant de travail auand il n'y a plus de connexion internet
22/10/2020,Ketly Jean-Pierre,I agree this would be a great option for those who have bad internet connections or those who travel quite often or even just work on right period. I hope this is in the works and will be ready in the near future.
18/10/2020,Suraj Kumar,I need it man
