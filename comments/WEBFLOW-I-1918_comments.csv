30/03/2020,James Watsson,wow! i really need this and finally found it in here. This is awesome. i love the way you shared was so smart way was.
27/04/2019,Vivek Raigaga,I agree! Would be nice to have similar functionality on the lightbox version of the video like the YouTube Video element.
22/03/2019,Webflow Team,Thanks for the clarification on this wishlist item.  I have updated the title of it.
22/03/2019,Inna Khoma,As far as I understand YouTube Video element allows more control on video settings and all tracking systems react on this element much better than general Video element. Maybe I should just write a wishlist for more control on video settings in lightbox?
21/03/2019,Webflow Team,You can already add a YouTube video in a Lightbox element. For more information on this please view this article: https://university.webflow.com/article/lightbox
