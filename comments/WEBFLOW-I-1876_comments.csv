23/12/2021,Casen,Having the ability to transfer a live project from an individual account to a team plan or the other way around would be amazing. Like others I'm facing a simliar issue where I have built sites in an individual account that need to get transferred to a team account but can't do so. Please consider incorporating this feature it will allow us to scale and bring more clients over to Webflow in the long run :)

22/04/2020,Susan MacPhee,I agree with Azai Studios I have 15 site with client billing and I wanted to move to Team but there is no way I can contact all the clients and explain what is happening regarding reimbursement etc. and make them redo their cards. This makes it hard to scale up to being a bigger agency and keeping as a freelancer.
19/01/2020,Thomas Beuls,Exactly this.
06/03/2019,Marcel Deelen,I totally agree and would like this to also be easier for working in an agile workflow where weekly updates done in a sandboxed version need to go online and replace the live version of a website.
05/03/2019,Bryan Garrant,For some reason I canâ€™t vote but please add this!!
02/03/2019,Azai Studios,I was just dealing with this issue!!!
