17/08/2021,Michael Viljoen,I am starting to feel quite exasperated and let down by not been able to implement client billing.
30/03/2021,Alberto Oliveira,Webflow must implement a way to pay using Brazilian real. We have a huge market here but it's very hard to explain to clients the benefits over the cost that is 2 times higher than hosting a wordpress website...
28/12/2020,Panwat Sa,Not seeing your country? Let's vote for this one https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2874
03/12/2020,Marcio Macedo,“We've extended Client Billing support for 16 new countries”
05/11/2020,Dmitry Ratnikov,Just chatted with support and was suggested to suggest a wishlist idea. So I think we need to get as many votes as possible on this to make that going.
06/07/2020,Fernando Klas,Brazil please... biggest wordpress market trying to move to webflow... but hitting a wall with some things...

24/05/2020,Dmitry Ratnikov,Adding new idea in continuation of my current one. I think we could add unsupported countries through PayPal given Webflow already added an e-commerce integration with them  I think it's totally possible https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-2874

15/09/2018,Daniel Infante,I hope you can add this feature for Mexico!
12/07/2018,Carla Olavio vieira,Other important thing based on this is a currency political prices is be adapted to each country:  https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1343
13/06/2018,Tim Vyas,Can I get some clarification? You seem to be saying that client billing in Russia is unsupported due to your payment processor Stripe; does this mean that you could charge in GBP or EUR?
07/04/2018,João carlos rossi Fonseca,Please! Asap!! Thanks.
09/01/2018,Ailton Augusto Silva,We Love!!!
