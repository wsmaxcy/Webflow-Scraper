22/06/2023,Shawn Meyer,It's frustrating that webflow doesn't consider this basic functionality
02/06/2023,Lindsey,Upvote. This is so confusing for clients who don't use the ecommerce portion of a template.
30/05/2023,Mark Drever,Ridiculous bug that needs to be fixed asap
29/05/2023,Sheree Dillon,I can't believe this isn't a thing. I downloaded an eCommerce template thinking surely I would be able to remove the eCommerce functionality pretty easily but turns out you can't. Starting to think I have to somehow start a new site. Not even sure I can now. Pretty disappointing for me and my client.
25/05/2023,Rosie FreelanceFlow,I hope this will be implemented soon. It is a bummer.
17/05/2023,John Mitchell,Upvoting! I love Webflow to bits going all the way back to 2014. I rarely have complaints about the platform but this one is hitting.
09/05/2023,Mathieu Preau,I clicked by mistake on a button an a whole ecommerce feature that is impossible to delete with a lot of unused templates pages are now here permanently. I hope you are working on that insane behaviour.
27/04/2023,Nathan Hovatter,Need to get this in the works asap
17/04/2023,Michelle Kreil,Is this gonna be available soon? The most frustrating thing is that the JS is huge (over 1MB) because of all that ecommerce stuff. Pageload sucks! Although I don't use ecommerce anymore it's still in the JS. I will copy-paste all my (very much) content into blank template now. Please stop me if you soon manage to develop an easier way than that. THANK YOU!
14/04/2023,Nick Houldsworth,Honestly this is such an unusual limitation in an otherwise excellent product. The offered workaround is to cross-site copy paste all the pages I want to keep then switch plans and domains over the new site... all because I can't deactive 2 default ecommerce pages.
16/03/2023,Dylan Worrall,Very frustrating when trying to port website to other platforms using udesly
16/03/2023,Dylan Worrall,how is this still not a thing
09/02/2023,Klaus Bartosch,We never use the ecommerce pages on our website and we cannot delete those pages means it is totally frustrating. When copy pasted the URL mentioned in the ecommerce pages the sites navigates to a blank page and it is not good for our SEO.  However I have added the <meta name="robots" content="noindex"> then with the URL it navigates to our site pointing out to a page. ETA for the feature to be implemented ?
08/02/2023,Guest,
24/01/2023,Web Wizard,My only choice is to pay $42/mo or unpublish the site completely?! This is insane!
19/01/2023,Isaac,Really disappointing. My first project looks dead in the water after PAYING! for a premium template that has a sales page that cannot be deleted!
19/01/2023,Sorakthun Ly,How many more votes do you need?
12/01/2023,Vinny Pizzi,Two years later and this has still not been implemented? Seems like an easy win. Ridiculous.
09/01/2023,Alexander Osborn,@webflow where are you??
05/01/2023,Will Hobbs,2023 and still needed
