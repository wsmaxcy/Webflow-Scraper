28/06/2022,Barbara Tien,Well hello there. Playing with it a bit further today I realized I could add any text character to a bullet and then use a negative text indent to simulate a bullet. Of course! Nevermind. A very fine workaround.  🤦‍♀️
27/06/2022,Barbara Tien,Yes please!!
12/03/2020,Paul Seymour,I can't make the space between the bullet and my text SMALLER... only use padding to make it bigger.
