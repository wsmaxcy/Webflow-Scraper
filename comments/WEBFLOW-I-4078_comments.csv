23/06/2023,Cole Schneider,I agree with Jurie's recent comment this is a bit of a deal-breaker for many users.  Unfortunately I was unaware until many hours into my site's development and am now at a frustrating crossroad that may lead me away from your platform.  In 2023 a 10mb limit for individual document uploads is an unexpected limitation.  This feature request is from 2021!  Please respond with where this item is on your development board.I imagine your support team has dealt with frustrated users due to this issue for years give them some relief!
21/06/2023,Jurie Van Staden,Why is the limit so small still? A 4 Mb limit in 2023 is just unacceptable.This post is from 2021. Has anything changed? When will we see an update Webflow?
