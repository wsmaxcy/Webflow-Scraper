19/08/2022,Ádám Simon,I'd like to bump up this thread because I found it very important. Working in 8pt instead of 10's is very important for professional designers. UI design softwares like Figma has this option called nudge amount.
30/06/2021,PG Gonni,I was referring to this panel here. I use 8px 16px 24px 32px and 40px constantly on all of my projects so the 0 10 20 40 etc. presets are useless to me.

30/06/2021,Webflow Admin,You should be able to set completely custom grid spacing and padding by the individual pixel. Can you clarify in more detail what you are looking for? Thank you!
