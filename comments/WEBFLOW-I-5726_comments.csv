21/06/2023,Paragram Team,This would be useful for so many things like saving items to their profile wishlists etc...
06/06/2023,Karl Reynolds,I’ve had to create workarounds for this in the meantime where I’ve had to use Zapier to add item IDs as text fields to User data. I can’t believe they didn’t treat Users like a CMS for beta where it could reference CMS collections and vice versa.
27/02/2023,Abdulrahman Hariri,Just started to test Webflow I can't believe this was not already implemented with the "users" functionality...
23/02/2023,Jo Lord,Also looking to do this shouldn't be too difficult to setup right? New user creates account my CMS should be able to draw from the data they input when signing up and I could reference that and update directly...
19/02/2023,Edward Kim,I've got membership system that I've created a community system that needs to work like that.  Right now I'm having to have member register with the basic information I'm then having to create manually the CMS about the newly registered account.  I've designed and develop it in such a way that I use the Account Update page with a fully functional online Form.  That is then emailed to me with all their input.  I manually then use those input to then create a CMS data account so that it can be now used as a public profile page with a direct link to it.  Meanwhile if any member logging in needs to use the Account Update page to fill in any data that they have NOT entered yet which then again emails me letting me now the changes and/or updates which I have to go in myself to find that data point and update that information or replace it.  So to the members I tell them it's not instant update but will take within 12 hours to update.  Usually I update it immediately since I don't have that many members but still I just tell them because of their public profile page I need to make sure their information is consistently formated correctly for the integrity and quality of their information displayed.  It would be SOOO awesome if it can link and allow members to update their own profile page.
09/01/2023,Herman Muurlink,It would be great to have this. I have been looking for a solution to have members create items that are only visible for that particular user.
