17/03/2020,Hamish Maclean,The whole OG implementation is incomplete and lack twitter cards
16/03/2020,Oli Timmis,In response to Nelson's reply...
27/02/2020,Rachel WastePlace,Would love to have this. I get that yeah in an ideal world it's different for each page. But having a default image for consistent branding is a lot better than having no image at all for the pages that it's not really worth your time making custom images for or that you just haven't gotten to yet... this omission is likely resulting in more pages with zero image than more pages with unique images. Having more pages with a default image is certainly better than the former while sure not quite as ideal as the latter. Let the end user decide how important that is to their business.
13/01/2020,Paul Seymour,I'm out of votes but this "feature" seems like bad UX.Â I am in cram mode and I'm manually placing the same image on every single page. The *real* way this should be implemented is an image (or all the Open Graph details) in the main settings screen and then keeping it as is per page if you want to manually override everything.
10/10/2019,Tiada Guru,I agree. I spent 45 minutes creating 10+ Open Graph images. Holy wow it's a PITA! If you aren't making money with better SEO I can see why most people would refuse to spend the time.
28/06/2019,Thais Lee,I'm really disappointed to see that it's not possible to set sitewide open graph content in Webflow (especially as it seems like this used to be a feature). As Oliver stated many clients have neither the budget nor the business need to display unique OG content when a specific link is shared. It feels a bit condescending to be honest to enforce such a resource intensive "best practice" on the client base. Would love to see you re-implement the sitewide standard or even heck a collection-based standard.
24/04/2019,Oliver Mcquitty,Thanks Nelson. One issue with this though is that some clients can't afford to hire a designer to design potentially 15+ Open Graph images and can therefore only produce a single one.
23/04/2019,Webflow Team,As stated on the Webflow University article:"Open Graph content works best when it's specific to the page being shared. For example your home page's Open Graph content should be different than your pricing page's. That's why there's no option to set OG settings globally."
