22/01/2019,Raul dario Acosta,please have the option to export to Wordpress and low the cms hosting price! too expensive
27/06/2018,Umberto Russo,Hi guys have you taken a look at the Udesly Adapter it's a Webflow to WordPress converter andÂ do the job smoothly:
05/12/2017,Guido Jansen,I agree. How weirdly it may sound but the option to have a good export option is actually a good reason to start working with a platform (or the other way around: not choosing a platform because export options are limited)
08/02/2017,Ezra Siton,WP its like a jungle (endless frameworks and builders = endless way to build the same thing). WP based on plugins for any "extra block" (gallery slider. ect.)...This is why the auto export will never work (also joomnla to WP. WP to drupal and so on). This is like auto tools to create "responsive sites" from html4 sites and ideas like this - bugs + unexpected results.
