20/06/2023,Brad Pickett,At least put it in your mid-tier e-comm plans - I'd pay more for this.
20/06/2023,Brad Pickett,Please please please Webflow. This would very appreciated - I can't sell properly.
20/02/2023,Graphics,yes I need 1500 variants. This is not going to work.
14/12/2022,Allen Hart,Honestly as amazing as WebFlow is for basic websites it's a horror story for real e-commerce applications. Truly a disappointment.
28/07/2022,Latitude 50,Frustrating! I have to recommend clients Shopify because of this.
09/06/2022,Brian Nguyen,One of the most frustrating parts of Webflow Ecommerce
24/11/2021,Valentin Pierrat,So frustrating!
26/08/2021,Sachin Zade,Lots of limitations here and there. It's really frustrating.
09/08/2021,Brad Cumbers,Just ran into this issue on my very first eCommerce project. Kids BJJ Belts Colour Size instant fail. Cmon guys this is not cheap software. 50 is ridiculous for paid CMS hosting.
12/07/2021,Mehmet Akin,50 is way to low to run a business. 50 is the bare minimum for ecommerce business.
31/05/2021,Simon Ester,I had to turn down a 25k project because of that :/
10/05/2021,Michael Gallagher,I completely agree! It’s very frustrating because if you have a few option sets (color material size) then you’re already so so limited. This is hands down the worst part about webflow.
13/10/2020,Michiko A.,I agree. It's so hard to recommend Webflow to clients when the # of variants are so limited :( I hope they increase this soon!
07/08/2020,Derek Rungsea,Agree I love webflow too but I'm not sure why so many of these features are so limited. Shopify and Squarespace for instance allow 100 variants per product. I'm not an experienced backend dev but this definitely sounds like it doesn't take much to increase this.
26/07/2020,Émile Perron,Agreed. The Webflow e-commerce system is incredibly impressive and powerful but the limitation of 50 variants per product makes it unusable for almost every project I have encountered / had to develop.
