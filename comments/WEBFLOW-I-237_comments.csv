14/04/2022,Alex Dixon,I can't help but feel that there is a conflict of interest between the Webflow Designer app and Webflow Cloud hosting (e.g. this feature would be very useful in the Webflow Designer but there is an internal concern that it may detract from the Webflow Cloud offering if implemented). This makes me think that features such as this are always destined to remain on the wishlist – I hope I'm wrong though.While the zip download does work it also creates a lot of unnecessary overhead for agencies that externally host a lot of websites.As a side note I'd love to host all our websites on Webflow Cloud but I've found that the pricing model doesn't really cater for many micro/small business clients that only need a brochure or microsite (versus other cloud hosting suppliers).
18/02/2022,Guest,Finally you can host your website in GitHub with Stacket: https://stacket.app/ of course automated uploads
25/11/2021,Alet Cedric,Hoping for 2022

19/05/2020,Adriano Teixeira Ramos,2020... still nothing
05/02/2020,Alex Dixon,This would be a huge time saving feature (for me atleast) especially for microsites where Webflow hosting isn't so cost effective.
26/07/2018,Ton Seemann,This post is from January 2017. It look likes that it's not so urgent for Webflow what I regret. For me and for now the reason not to start with Webflow. I understand that Webflow try to sell their own hosting but a lot of websigners do have their own servers.
25/07/2018,Michael Viljoen,Using Webflow hosting for my clients would significantly increase the cost to business for the hosting service I provide as I also provide email so I would then be paying for web hosting twice. FTP would significantly improve the workflow and experience of using Webflow for all my sites with the many small changes I make to them continuously. Don't mind paying additionally for CMS as this is easier for me to sell on to clients than straight forward small sites.
17/07/2018,David,I voted this 3 votes. This is a necessity. I understand the conflict of interest with Webflow hosting but this should be a given if Webflow's goal is to provide the best service in this web space. If Webflow's hosting plans offer the best value there shouldn't be a problem with people migrating their hosting away from Webflow.
16/07/2018,Graham Barr,I 'get' that Webflow would prefer everyone to sign-up to their hosting plans. Unfortunately the Webflow hosting fees are way too high for pro designers. Further many require cPanel hosting for the extra functionality including email admin. For these reasons pro designers will never be able to consider Webflow hosting so why 'punish' us for not wishing to use your hosting plans?  FTP upload would make our daily tasks so much easier.
27/04/2018,Benjamin Mackert,For me it´s also the missing thing. It´s absolutely nessessary to be integrated
24/04/2018,Mahir Dzambegovic,I don't understand why this feature isn't requested by more people. A lot of people I work for have already their own hosting because it's cheaper for them.
15/04/2018,Daniel Maier,Any News about this feature?
04/07/2017,World Web Development,This would actually be a really great feature. Setting up FTP credentials in the project and then just simply publishing to ftp.
13/02/2017,Roberto,I have to totally agree! I have several websites that I manage with the classic FTP and be able to upload the files directly from WebFlow would give a touch of professionality to all the system. Having to download the files and then load them to the external ftp is just a waste of time.
04/02/2017,Dmitry Ratnikov,Would be great thanks for the idea!
