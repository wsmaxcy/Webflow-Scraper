13/08/2020,Timothy Ricks,A workaround way to do this is drop in a Collection List. Each of the collection items should be Page Sections so the client can add them in whatever order they want. Then you add a dropdown in the Sections CMS where the client can select what type of section they want to add to the page (Image + Heading + Button Full-Width Video Three Column Section etc.). Once the client selects one of the predesigned layouts for that section item you use conditional visibility to reveal that design within the section item. Here’s a quick tutorial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxx4JqmGbV0
16/08/2018,Jarno Michel,I thinks it is the same idea as this one?: https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-61
06/08/2018,Robert Ijsselstein,Thanks for your reactions! Just a brainstorm:- The designer has the power to pre-design sections- The designer has the power to choose where these sections can be placed (between other sections)- The client has the power to add these pre-designed sections to the place the designer chose- The client has the power to change to content of these sections but nothing else- The client has the power to remove these sectionsThere are a few problems that need some thinking (maybe not right now) for example:- Would the client be able to add multiple sections in one spot? It depends I guess?- Would the client be able to add multiple DIFFERENT sections after each other?- How do we keep all the sections organised? - How does the client know where he can put these sections?- etc.
02/08/2018,Webflow Team,interesting submission.  But just a thought.  Wouldn't these sections need to be approved of by the you the designer?  Because you're essentially giving your clients the power to become designers when they may not have the full understanding of UX and design.
01/08/2018,Noah Raskin,I think this would be awesome!! A lot of my clients always ask if they have the option to add or remove html elements. So I agree! This would be amazing.
