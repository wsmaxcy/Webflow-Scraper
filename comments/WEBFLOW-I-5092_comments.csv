25/06/2023,Andreas Christofi,This feature is probably the biggest pain in the entire process. First of all I can't believe that everything is editable by default. There should have been an option that disables this universally. I don't know about you but I don't trust my clients that much.
14/06/2023,Jonny Haynes,+1 billionThis is needed ASAP
13/06/2023,Martin Roth,this is so important!!!
05/05/2023,Wouter van Waning,Finishing up on my first big Webflow CMS project. Happy creating everything so far with so many beautiful workflows around implementing CMS elements but absolutely stunned to find out I have to deselect every "Collaborators can edit this element" on the site to prevent future disasters once giving my client access. I was expecting something so radically more advanced from this beautiful platform that I'm quite shocked...
15/02/2023,LTTR CORP,Please whyyyyyyy I will cryyyyyyy
15/02/2023,LTTR CORP,Ouch Seriously? Do I have to walk through every element on my page to prevent from editors editing? Nor I can prevent whole pages? Why? why? Such an obvious feature and it's not there.
06/12/2022,Erasme,Please...
30/11/2022,Maurizio De Luca,What they said +++. I also think any new element/page created should have "editable by collaborators" OFF by default so that we can turn it ON ourselves for  specific things. I see collaborators as clients with just enough knowledge to mess things up. If I wanted someone else to help with developing the website I would  add him/her as an admin instead (i.e. a fellow developer). Would also be great to be able to limit collaborators' access to just specific CMS lists not the all collection so that they can add new "products" for example but not mess with anything else. I am new to this so forgive me if some of the things I mentioned are already possible.
26/09/2022,Sichtwerk,++ Yes Please!!! ItÂ´s a pain in the ass to manually go through each and every element to deactivate this!
17/09/2022,Marcello Violini,please!
