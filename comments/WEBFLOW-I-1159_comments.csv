13/01/2020,Kevin Holland,My client requests billing reminders similar to this use case although monthly. This would be similar to how Mint or other 3rd parties will send notices to remind me of bills I have on autopay about to be paid in x amount of days and the amount. Jordan at Webflow has recommended I try right in box to achieve this. I'll come back and let you know how it went in 30 days.
