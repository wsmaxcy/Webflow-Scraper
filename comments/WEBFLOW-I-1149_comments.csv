20/06/2023,Matt Neve,Is this really 5 years old now. We have had a lot of clients asking for this recently as the world becomes more and more aware of SEO case and accessibility cases. I hope this is a light feature to be added any day now as its hard to tell a client they can't do this.
12/06/2023,Robbin Jansen,Why is this not a feature?? This is an absolute MUST
17/05/2023,Dayna,WE NEED THIS WTF
15/04/2023,Webagentur Ol,Still nothing ?
28/03/2023,Jeremy Bauman,WHAT!? how is this not a feature? Does webflow not care about helping makes sites accessible??
03/03/2023,Webflow Agentur Oldenburg,Please add this.
10/02/2023,Jon Burdon,Please please please implement this Webflow! This has been four years now and this is Essential for clients. Please explain why this is not implemented.
08/11/2022,Whit Gurley,Really stunned to discover this missing. Come on guys this is critical.
27/10/2022,Jeff Croot,Hi Webflow is there an update on this? Really is something that's desperately needed especially with the recent hosting price increases.
24/10/2022,Carl Labanz,I'm constantly surprised by what's not possible through the client editor.
18/08/2022,Brian Walker,Considering Webflow's partner program grading rubric has a requirement for clear and useful alt tags and out of all the rubric categories this has the highest score of 15% (all others 10 and under) I would have thought this was beyond the "reviewed" stage. Can you please allow our clients to edit alt tags on their websites? Not only do we all believe it is essential so do you.
07/07/2022,Brent,This seems pretty critical to me! Currently the issue means once I launch a client website they'll have to send any image changes to ME to update on their site since alt text is essential. Bummer!
22/04/2022,Inosida,The lack of this feature is the only reason that we cannot host our clients sites on webflow. It's a shame that such a small thing makes the "editor" worthless for our clients. Just add the feature already...
13/01/2022,Pablo Magana,Any update from Webflow team on this issue?
03/06/2021,Laplie Anderson,This feature was not "SHIPPED".  That's a lie. The simplist use case is changing the alt text of a static image. That is not supported.
13/05/2021,Tom Rushworth,To add to this thread also if I have an image on the site with an alt tag set and then in the editor update the image the alt tag gets removed. This is not good for site SEO.
13/05/2021,Tom Rushworth,One of the big selling points of Webflow is the ease of use for the client to update content using the editor without being able to create/update alt tags from the editor is a major set back. Please Webflow fix this issue I don't want my clients to want to use Wordpress any more!! This is basic CMS functionality from their point of view.
27/01/2021,Jonathan Haring,Mandatory for accessibility! Most of my clients don't use the designer and exclusively use the editor. Clients who need to replace non-collection images are struggling since certain accessibility standards are now legally risky or illegal (California/EU) and I'm having to manually make changes for them which isn't sustainable.
11/08/2020,Steven Moseley,100% please add this as others have said this is now a designer task when it really should be an editor task.
10/08/2020,Aidan Quigley,This would make website SEO a lot easier please add this Webflow team!
