11/05/2023,Daniel Blank,Yes this feature sure would be handy!
26/04/2023,Catalin,Wow... This needs to be implemented.
09/03/2023,Rien,This is still a very welcome feature. I'll describe our use case for this. We have customer success stories on our website. They are in a caroussel on the homepage and you can click on one to go to the respective page with the full story. I want the title of that page to be<h1>Customer success story: {companyName}</h1>However I can´t do this right now! Making two h1-tags to achieve this would of course be a nightmare for SEO.

08/05/2022,Gregory Hill,This would be a really big help and make a world of difference. It’s a major oversight for a basic functionality in my own humble opinion. Please do address this.
