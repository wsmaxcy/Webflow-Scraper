22/05/2023,Brahim Sliti,Hey Christian Renner! ðŸ‘‹I am currently planning to build a simple app to help us manage assets for now I am focusing on being able to get clean and professional Asset URLs instead of the ugly URLs Webflow provides us.I may be adding a feature to easily replace files as well and not have to deal with this kind of problem anymore...I am currently launching a WAITING LIST so if you really want that issue to be solved and why not ask for other requests subscribe here: https://cleanassetlink.webflow.io/
