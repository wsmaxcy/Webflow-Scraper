16/03/2019,Jean-Pierre Stopinski,In a recent Webflow tutorial video a panel like this was used. I was wondering if this was a new feature but unfortunately afaict they only use it for tutorial purposes.This feature would make my day 100000 times more easy.We work on a lot of different projects and sometimes when refactoring only a few components webflow as a small visual css editor would help a looottt. Just to design a component and output the various portions you need instead of having to export the whole css code and picking out pieces one by one.Please share this awesome internal tool with us @webflow!
