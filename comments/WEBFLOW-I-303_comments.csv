16/06/2023,Keegan Robinson,If this could get added it would be really helpful. I have to imagine it'd also reduce the storage space needed for sites since I've had to add the same image multiple times in different spots when I could have referenced the same one from the media library.
11/06/2023,Alejandro Blaas,6 years since opened...
06/06/2023,Tracy Dungo,Come on team let's get this done.
20/04/2023,Johanna Maijgren,We really needs this!
18/04/2023,Jason Rozander,Please add this feature. Wordpress could do this in 2003.
17/04/2023,Convincible Media,How can this not already be a feature?
17/04/2023,Stof Hofer,Yes please bridge this sloppy gap. :-(
16/04/2023,Daniel,Please add this. Nearly 500 votes.
12/04/2023,Alexander Engl,How is this not a feature after 5 years?
28/03/2023,Deveb .co,This is a really important feature we need immediately.
23/03/2023,Kurtis Allen,Some of the limitations in Webflow â€“ like this one â€“ make me miss Wordpress.
09/03/2023,Amanda Jus,The fact that we can't find all the images added in the project inside the Assets Panel is actually very frustrating and as commented bellow the workarounds are very time consuming.
01/03/2023,Brandon West,This vote was from 6 years ago now. Maybe this year will be the year they add this feature. Fingers crossed
11/02/2023,Tony Peacock,I agree that this is a feature that should have already been implemented. With the ability to compress files in the asset manager it is even more valuable. Please prioritize this as the workarounds are very time consuming.
22/01/2023,MR D.,I spent the weekend learning and experimenting with Webflow. Despite my love for the tool I was disappointed to find that certain features such as the ability to select previously uploaded assets within the CMS page template are not supported.
03/01/2023,Diamond Dan,HOW IS THIS NOT A FEATURE! Unbelievable. It's such a basic thing I don't understand
14/12/2022,Jim Yeh,This is madness. it's making my buddy david very angry
13/12/2022,Pam Sykes,It's absolutely ludicrous that this very basic feature is still on the wishlist five years later. It's one of those little bits of friction that makes me hate Webflow every single day.
29/11/2022,Andrea Cornejo,Can't understand why this is not already a feature? ðŸ«¤
17/11/2022,Steven Maas,This is currently deal-breaking for our organization and discouraging us to move over 50 websites to this platform.
