26/12/2018,Chase Razabdouski,I came here to make this exact suggestion as a real "killer feature" for Webflow.  My hope is to add a few suggestions to make this something manageable for both Webflow's development team and all of us using Webflow for design.

05/11/2018,Allen Matsumoto,It would be nice to have the extra detail of specifically how much time was spent in a Webflow project. Full-on time tracking tools are ok when you to track multiple project time across multiple apps which is pretty common for a lot of us. But they also require a commitment to maintain and manage and since there's no magic wand to accurately capture what you're doing on/off and idle at computer for many of us they aren't worth the effort.
