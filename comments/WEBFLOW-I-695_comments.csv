19/06/2023,Kasper Dam,This seems like kindergarten functionality that was just seemingly forgotten? :(
16/11/2022,John Gilbert,Nice content you are given and it's very informative and if you are going to buy a domain you need a proper research on it and for the relevant domain you need to pay for it so you can also get 200 instant loan which is enough for the domain.
11/09/2022,Andrew Chisholm,I really wish this feature request was acted upon. The automatic sitemap feature in Webflow has ruined my SEO by showing Google tag indexes user quote indexes etc. I'd love to be able to remove sections of my site from the automatic sitemap...
26/10/2021,Collin Belt,Agreed this would be incredibly helpful. In other platforms (such as Squarespace) there is a toggle to no-index the page and hide it from the automatically generated sitemap. Having a similar option would save us a lot of time and be much cleaner from an SEO perspective.
13/08/2021,Raghu Kashyap,I think the ability to define which subdomain to use as default is very important.

08/07/2020,Kjetil Grøsland,I'm a bit surprised to encounter this one as Webflow is so rich already on functionality. I wish for a simple switch button on Page settings allowing us to hide page from sitemap and to set no-index. Same issue her. Getting error from Search console since I both added no-index to page but it's still in sitemap.xml. Confusing google.
16/06/2020,Chris Erickson,This would be such an SEO win. No need to waste crawl budget on pages we have no index tag on. Also might be some pages we want to hide from public view (like landing pages for ads etc). Exposing all pages in a sitemap makes all of this more difficult than it needs to be.
20/05/2020,Robert,It would be great to exclude folders from the sitemap :)
15/05/2020,Justin,We need the ability on each page cms template page and cms child pages to check a checkbox that adds a no index meta tag. This would also remove that page from the auto sitemap since Google Search console marks a page as an error if you add no index code but it shows on the sitemap. Also the auto sitemap needs to include all pages including cms pages. All of this is important to technical SEO.

16/08/2019,Axel Sturmann,This would be very useful! And a page level option (preferably with check boxes) to auto add the following to each page:Noindex Nofollow Noarchive NosnippetMany thanks
19/07/2019,Austin Hellman,This is an essential feature for SEO. I am getting Google Search Console errors for using my robots.txt file or using a noindex tag with pages that are submitted in the automatically generated sitemap. There seems to be no way to get around this unless I upload the sitemap manually which is not user-friendly or realistic.
16/02/2019,Brandon Urich,Yes! I'm adding No Index No Follow in the head on certain pages but then you get a GSC error because the pages still show up in the submitted site map. A control to allow "Exclude from Sitemap" is highly needed in order to adhere to best practices. This is very much needed for collection page templates since in some cases the individual collection item page doesn't ever need to be visited.
12/02/2018,Christoffer Furnes,Sometimes I make collections specifically to be used as a multi-reference filtering functionality in other collections. The problem is that this collection also get a public collection url that will be indexed by Google if the Auto-generate Sitemap function in Webflow is used.
09/02/2018,Diarmuid Sexton,This feature would be great and is much needed! Clients seeing lots of errors on Search Console due to <meta name="robots" content="noindex"> that I've embedded on collection pages which are just for reference. If these pages were hidden from the sitemap there would be no errors.
05/02/2018,Evan McDaniel,I'd like to see the ability to indicate which domain should be used for the sitemap file. We use 4 domains per site on average (internal version client facing non-public version www live version non-www live version that redirects to www) and it's a mystery as to which gets used in the sitemap and there is currently no way to change it.
09/08/2017,Cameron Roe,I also think it would be amazing to have a sitemap diagramming tool built into Webflow. For example you could go to a separate section under the Assets tab and it would show a visual sitemap as a diagram of all the pages on the site. The view would overlap the designer section and you could drag your page structure around in a more sophisticated manner. What would be nice is to see all the routes (with dynamic parameters from CMS) and update them by simply re-ordering or renaming the route structure.
31/07/2017,Noelle Greenwood,Yes! This! Webflow masters - please can you advise when this might be considered? The conflicting messages for google is not great SEO... :(
