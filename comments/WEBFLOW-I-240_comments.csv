02/06/2023,Hey Gianluca,Was just looking for this feature and surprised it wasn't already part of the webflow functionality.
12/03/2023,Ramy,Agreed crazy that this hasn't caught on yet but they're already thinking about making their CMS multilingual while they haven't even addressed the basic needs of a good functioning CMS...
12/03/2023,Ramy,That this isn't addressed yet is a joke. Claiming to be one of the most user friendly & powerful CMS's that doesn't even have repeater fields for clients to use. This is very much required for almost every project. Especially for managing images on a lot of projects...
10/11/2022,Manuel Engler,This is needed so badly!
25/10/2022,Jonathan Wagoner,Really need this as well. Also pretty shocked this isn't something even being reviewed as it's pretty common for a CMS.I'm building out a sports website and I need to be able to show event scores. So I need a way for the content editor to reference a player and their score and keep adding that combo (player/score) for as many players were in that event. The player coming from a reference field within another collection and a score being a number field. Not really sure there is a way currently to do this since each event could have different players different scores and a different amount of players.
07/09/2022,Ron Biton,Cmmon how come this is not part of it. I was excited using Webflow for exacly 15 minutes until I realized that.
06/09/2022,Jon Burdon,PLEASE can we have this. For dynamic sites it's absolutely essential. The multi image field is the closest thing we have and it's just like having your hands tied.
18/08/2022,Marc Ricketts,I think that this is basic. Instead of having to predict the number of whatever something that a user will want to include on their page or duplicate that field with 1 2 3 ... up to the limit of fields allowed the user can simply click to add an additional whatever something.
18/08/2022,Sebastian Frommberger,This needs way more votes! Advanced Custom Fields is such a great example of how to set up dynamic and intuitiv collections for editors without over expanding an collection item.
13/07/2022,Build Digital Studio,Praying Webflow reviews this..  Really struggling with some pretty straightforward client CMS requests.
21/06/2022,Dylan Colby,We NEED dynamic page zones like this to create custom page layouts in the CMS. This is CRUCIAL to Webflow.
21/04/2022,Renee Martin,This should get a high priority - every site I have built with WP uses ACF repeating fields. Am currently evaluating Webflow and have purchased a subscription to create a proof of concept. This along with inability to create hierarchal categories may be show stoppers.
30/03/2022,Ryan,(I posted this over on the forums but thought it worth saying here too)
25/02/2022,Wernich,We're currently reviewing Webflows limitations to see if our agency should incorporate it in into out stack. I have to say this one surprised me. So for a client to manage simple product details with repeater fields is not possible?!
17/01/2022,Moshe Morris,I second (and third and fourth etc) the want/need for this feature.  What's more I am wondering why this request hasn't even been reviewed (at least there is no "reviewed" tag on this suggestion).  There are requests with literally only 1 vote that are marked with the review tag.  Indeed there are requests with only 1 vote that have a tag of "planning" and some with as little as 11 votes that are "in development".  And yet this is a 4 year old request with over two hundreds votes that would greatly improve the power and flexibility of the webflow cms.  As such I would like to please request that you take (another?) look at this request as well as write an update on what are webflows plans vis-a-vis this request.  Thanks :).

02/12/2021,Rick Erickson,It'd be in Webflow's best interest to add this functionality while Editor X is still maddeningly buggy (perhaps fatally broken) for sure!
13/09/2021,Nelson C.,This is a must need to build scalable CMS pages
19/07/2021,Yigit Arslan,This would be a game changer for all Webflow users. Please make this happen.
06/07/2021,Rob Nichols,Still really want this feature.
