27/05/2023,Vanesa Edo,The site I am working on have no sense without this function. Look for a solution out of Webflow makes me loose valuable time. Please add this function.
24/05/2023,Bill,Absolute necessity for almost any site.
18/05/2023,Jonathan,Still paying Finsweet $24/mo for the ability to sort CMS items for our customers. Be great if this was included...
10/05/2023,Oliver Scholl,Seems to be a basic function needed also just to show off the power of your CMS... if it could ;)
09/05/2023,Bevy Sounds,We NEED this feature please :)
30/04/2023,Jonas Sispele,it's 2023 and I still make wordpress sites because of this. it's not optional clients require it.
25/04/2023,Stefan Rimola,+1 essential feature that does not take much effort to implement

13/03/2023,Brent Lagerman,refukus has a solution for that I think webflow should concentrate on other things that have no third party solution like adding schema support for instance. https://www.webflow-tools.refokus.com/

13/02/2023,Ben Thompson,+1 to filter collection list blog topics/tags.
12/02/2023,Ben Crawford,With the CMS features this feels like it would be a big win. Big expansion on what can be built. I'm looking at a short-term marketing site where we want to quickly narrow options and present the right CTA.
10/02/2023,Small Potion,Hi you can do that using atributes from finsweet.
22/01/2023,Ryan G,How is this not a thing? Starting to regret my decision to migrate a sizeable WordPress site over to Webflow; silly me for assuming an industry-standard essential feature would have been supported here I guess.
03/01/2023,Gabriele Schobess,Would like to give all previous comments a "like". Hope this feature will be released soon.
01/01/2023,Georg Kuklick,This is just one of the too many embarrassing issues webflow isn't willing or able to solve. Who wonders why there are already rumors about massive layoffs in 2023? Does webflow bite more than it can chew when talking about targeting enterprise clients next? What about closing all the ridiculous gaps first to make webflow more than just a marketing-website-editor?
29/12/2022,Jane,Must have not nice to have.
