05/07/2017,Eva Pettifor,I would love to see this even if it wasn't as fancy as letting the user position their image (which would be awesome!) but to start off with if it could be resized/cropped automatically from the centre of the image would be a huge improvement on the limited way we can do it now. I often do layouts with images that need to be an exact size/proportions and expecting my clients to resize to pixel perfect size from experience never happens and they either mess up their page or need to ask me to do this for them. Thanks.
