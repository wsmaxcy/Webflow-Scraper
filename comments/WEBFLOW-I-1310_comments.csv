22/05/2023,Brahim Sliti,Hey! ðŸ‘‹I am currently planning to build a simple app to help us manage assets for now I am focusing on being able to get clean and professional Asset URLs instead of the ugly URLs Webflow provides us.I may be adding a feature to easily replace files as well and not have to deal with this kind of problem anymore...I am currently launching a WAITING LIST so if you really want that issue to be solved and why not ask for other requests subscribe here: https://cleanassetlink.webflow.io/
03/05/2023,Pat Donaghy,Pleeeeeeease add this!
12/04/2023,Edwin Brito,
04/04/2023,Aquagga Inc.,In 2023 not seeing how to replace a file which breaks the ability to host and link files that periodically need to be updated. PLEASE ADD THIS FEATURE
05/12/2022,Allan Levy,Come on Webflow catch up with what your users need. Based on the thread we've been asking for this very basic feature for YEARS!
07/11/2022,Scott Hieatt,You've got to be kidding me...
16/09/2022,Taylor Osborn,Honestly embarrassing that this wasn't a launch feature
13/09/2022,James Lu,You can't be serious I can't do this...it's 2022!
06/09/2022,Carlos Tocchetto,This feature is one of the most important ones for easy website management.
11/08/2022,Martin Schwenzer,replacing images from the file manager would be much easier than changing them everywhere used.
04/08/2022,Brent Lagerman,I've wondered about this one in the past +1
07/06/2022,Aaron Zide,It's now 2022 this is a generally obvious and much needed feature. If you use the CMS to host PDF resources or file assets that are located in multiple locations across the site updating the original source asset by replacing the file would then update it across the site in one process vs what it happening now.
06/06/2022,Antonia Pervanidis,please add this. it is necessary for me too.
09/05/2022,Evo-Lite Marketing,Give us access to the server if you are not going to build this in. That way we can update/replace the file like web designers have been able to since the start of the internet...
07/04/2022,Colin Martin,Hey Webflow why is this not sorted? You have this developement money but you're missing some basics which let down the app. and make larger business site builds a bit of a joke.
31/03/2022,Ernst RosÃ©n,c'mon you gotta add this ...
02/02/2022,Martin Hattingh,Please add this we have no idea which images and PDFs are in use and which not...
29/11/2021,Claude HÃ¤ring,Please add it! Would save a lot of time!!
12/10/2021,Benjamin Ross,Please add this feature!
