25/04/2023,Pde Admin,This is table stakes for any modern business site. I look forward to this being done soon.
30/11/2022,Connor Hansen,2022 and this is still not available??? Webflow?????????
15/09/2022,Esben Engsted,This would be great have had the above problems stated with SVG's recently. Getting the currentColor feature to work would be a nice little fix at least.
18/07/2022,Dark Hawk,Thank you. I will try your methods to increase my knowledge.

18/05/2022,Cookies & MILK,Another example of WF droping the ball on simple features.
07/04/2022,INAGREAT,I really can't believe this still isn't done! What the HELL Webflow. This comment was created all the way back in 2018 and it's now 2022. This is one of the most fundamental features that should have been available from the beginning. All websites need SVGs at some point for many elements like custom icons and buttons... There are other web builders that provide this and Webflow still doesn't. It's Unbelievable how you guys completely ignore this community of paying customers! ü§¨
21/02/2022,Guest,Thank you for sharing your valuable solution it's work properly.
10/02/2022,Thanh Miller,Thanks for the update. I'll be sure to keep an eye on this thread.
07/02/2022,Guest,Thank you for sharing your valuable solution it's work properly.
01/02/2022,Ladarius Lang,Did you have a fix on this issue? MyGiftCardSite Challenging a relative issue yet no response from anyone and couldn't see this point taking a gander at in google.
08/01/2022,Jacob Williams,This would be amazing. WE NEED THIS!
02/01/2022,Nils,PLEASE!
25/11/2021,Winona Homenick,Embed an SVG via an <img> element you just need to reference it in the src attribute as you'd expect. You will need a height or a width attribute
23/07/2021,Swift Storm,CSS is supposed to make these tasks faster but nope not in webflow because webflow restrictions. so dumb.
25/03/2021,Mike Escoffery,Please THIS!!!
11/12/2020,Tansen BEL,It would save so much time !
11/09/2020,Glenn Eastland,Would be useful. If the SVG is a single colour you can use Opactity and Filters but it's not a great substitute.
13/06/2020,Ghous Shah,Please add this to webflowIt will save us a LOT OF TIME
09/05/2020,Leonardo Tanuwijaya,I've been dreading for this feature would love for this feature to be realised. Webflow has been very important piece in my work and this feature would help a lot
