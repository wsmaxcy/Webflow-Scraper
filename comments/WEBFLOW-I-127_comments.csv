08/01/2021,SEM LTD,Would love to have basic text editing functionality!
15/10/2020,Lucy McA,100% agree with Markus' points below RE sub and superscript. When do you think these features will become a reality?
21/11/2017,Otto Grimpo,Our customers would love it :)
13/02/2017,Markus J.,I agree that more options are needed – also sub- and superscript. However I'm sceptical about making these toolbar buttons available by default. Ideally I would like to be able to activate/disable them depending on the project in order to restrict contributors to use only permitted styling rather than play around as they please. Another option would be the ability to set up and make available in the Editor toolbar custom styles that can be applied to text. Surreal CMS has this function and it allows great flexibility re. styling as needed.
