23/03/2023,Mario Garcia,I like the idea they should also implement more things like this at least not to be looking for solutions to third parties better that all the payment is in one place.
19/01/2022,Anna Clark,I would love to see this there are so many applications for this service. There are lots of expensive or bad solutions out there something native to webflow would be a lifesaver. Very few booking services offer week-long course bookings. This would be a big advantage for webflow if they could offer it.

07/10/2020,Sibi Health,Any updates on when this will be available? So many people these days including myself want to build an "Airbnb for X" and there is no platform that allows you to create a customizable version (Sharetribe is terrible). If webflow adds multi-seller appointment booking functionality with live calendars/google cal integration that would be a game changer.
20/05/2020,Jay Bussiere,I use acuity but love to see this functionality!
30/07/2019,Nathan Graves,I used a program called Setmore.  They let you add your services and prices.  Setmore also lets you embed their program on your website or Facebook.  The services is free except for Google Calendar integration and texting for appointment reminders.  That service is $25 a month as of this post.
14/01/2019,Guest,Also the way https://www.kinelabo.be/wie-zijn-wij works is a link to https://altagenda.crossuite.com/Kinelabo/l/n5r4v5z5j454r264c444/o/a4z26494
29/06/2018,Ben W.,I would like to see a event / appointment booking feature maybe it fits well with the coming e-commerce …But an extra fee of $50 oder even $20 is way to much in my opinion there are wordpress plugins doing it for free.
