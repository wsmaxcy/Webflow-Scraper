21/10/2020,Dauren Meiramkulov,YES PLS!
01/09/2020,Veaceslav,absolutely yes it will be nice
09/08/2020,Valentino Figueroa,Bro.. Yes.
31/07/2020,Dan Gayle,Yes please! This is something that would be of huge value and seems to be missing relative to other website platforms.
03/05/2020,Gaynes Kayce,Yes please.
13/02/2020,Alex Navarro,Please provide a strong and stable solution for dropshipping. Webflow has great design and customisation capabilities so if we could use Webflow to create a brand that uses dropshipping as a fulfilment method it would be great! You would help many people.
05/09/2019,David miranda,Any update on this? I think this is the one think that webflow is lacking
06/08/2019,David Talas,I vote for this too. For now it looks like I need to add a subdomain for my shopify store but then it will still be tricky to implement with facebook pixel...
16/07/2019,Glenn McWhinney,I'm also interested in making use of Webflow for funnel building and so having the droppshipping feature set baked in would make my life so much better. For now Shopify seems to be the best option but I'm looking forward to the day that Webflow nails this like it does with everything. +3 votes
04/07/2019,Lawren Ayala,The only reason I haven't started using Webflow is because this is the exact feature I am looking for. Besides that everything else is absolutely great!
31/05/2019,Detlev Obst,My vote is simply to infuse logic that will allow me to dropship from any manufacturer incl automatic inventory updates order notifications splitting orders by manufacturer fulfillment notifications/status payments returns ...
03/05/2019,Chris Sharp,Yea we need Orbelo style importing of Aliexpress products into your Webflow store asap. Youd get so many people switching to Web flow from sportify.
10/04/2019,Guillaume Chamant,Hello I'd like to have some updates about dropshipping with webflow from platforms like Printful AliExpress Amazon... I checked some videos but didn't find updates.
20/02/2019,Kevin Holland,@AmenityAnalytics what extension did you use for that link?
28/09/2018,AmenityAnalytics Viewer,This is already being planned https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JpbiItjrfU watch this :)
