06/07/2021,Travis Austin,@Webflow Admin I'll respond for the Original Poster but yes basically you are right! Imagine the designer/developer for the site has a % cut or a flat fee from all of the sales and other customers can sign up to be a vendor possibly going through a sort of approval process? The approval process could be down the line since it's not essential functionality but the new vendors could sell other items to get a large majority cut of profit with the designer initially setting up the website to make a marketplace for other vendors to sell on thus getting a cut of all sales.
