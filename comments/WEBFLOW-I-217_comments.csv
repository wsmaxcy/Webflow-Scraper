05/01/2021,Kenneth Rowe,Could someone explain why we still don't have this option? It seems like an odd oversight. Will it create some kind of problem I'm not seeing?

06/05/2020,Ali Abbas,This feature is long overdue. Let's see some features that improve on what makes Webflow great in the first place: tools to help you design faster.
27/09/2017,D P,I've also requested this many times directly messaging them. It is desperately needed with a big site the class system can get messy and sometimes you just need a need class with those styles for interactions and things. I also requested many times the duplicate class function which I see was also voted on in here and got done. Which has made a HUGE difference however it doesn't cater for every scenario such as working on an older site or interactions or just situations you need to go down the class rabbit hole and start afresh on a new flattened-cloned class. Please add.
