17/10/2022,Cesar Lopez,On September 22 Webflow announced an upcoming feature that allows clients to add unlimited Workspace Guests. This is a promising fix for the problem of using Webflow for client projects that was compounded by the elimination of Client Billing. It looks like it will be similar to Weebly's "Site Editor - Admin" function that's been around for over 10 years. If Workspace Guest works as expected it should make Webflow feel like it's back on track with the future in mind.
11/04/2022,Guest,This works really well for me thank you! Facing same issue here. Help is appreciated.
07/04/2022,INAGREAT,I cant believe how much we pay Webflow to be ignored! If they don't get their shit together I'm leaving! ðŸ¤¬
06/04/2022,Ian Russell,Yes this is the clear path forward. We can't ask our clients to sign up for a new account and then share their login information. This is terrible security protocol and we shouldn't be encouraging it. Sites need to have multiple superadmins.
06/04/2022,INAGREAT,Cesar Lopez Thank you! This feedback was very thorough and I hope they read it. I have to say I do agree with Giuseppe Legrottaglie. But you're right too I guess "beggars can't be choosers" so if they're going to remove client billing at the very least they need to give us a master admin account possibly even a company admin account. This would be a much better solution than that ridiculous partnership with Bonsai. I already use Quickbooks so giving us a deal on Bonsai doesn't help me at all. Your Idea would at least make it a little easier to deal with this magnitude of change.
06/04/2022,Giuseppe Legrottaglie,Great idea and super shareable.
