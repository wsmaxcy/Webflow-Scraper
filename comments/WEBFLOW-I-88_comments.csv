08/08/2022,Georg Kuklick,Is there still no progress?
13/01/2021,Alfredo Rodriguez,Definitely a MUST!!
16/12/2019,Greg Washington,I want to create archive pages for a publishing site that gives people the ability to only view collection items from a specific year or year+month.
19/07/2019,Mauricio Bazán,I think this is definitely a MUST idea. It will be so useful for events that last more than one day for special offers that ends at a specific time for calendars and much more!
19/12/2018,Rebekah Daniels,Yes! I need to conditionally format date ranges on events spanning multiple days (November 30 - 31 rather than November 30 - November 31 for instance).
24/11/2018,Hamish Maclean,😬
15/11/2018,Василий Никоноров,Need it a lot to represent items by years: 2012 2013 2014 etc.
06/08/2018,Kjell Ruben S.,Yes this is a must have. I can't believe this is not on the wishlist already! I have 4 websites that needs this today!
10/02/2018,Hywel Thomas,Only 13 votes? I would have thought we'd have a lot more by now...
13/11/2017,Vincent Bidaux,Also taking care of periods like "months". There is no way to filter things happening this monthor a given month or 6 months from now. All my callections of events hae a date field plus many text fields for months days and other stuff related to dates. Like 2 fields for hours and minutes in international format.
03/07/2017,Vincent Bidaux,If there's several events per day there is currently no way to hide the past events... Like departures. The only possible filtering is per day.
20/01/2017,Pedro Alfonso,Yes! We need the ability to show/hide dynamic events based in a date range.
18/01/2017,Tobias Heilmann-Schuricht,Totally agree. At the moment we manually "turn off" items once they have passed the current date... automation would be very helpful here.
