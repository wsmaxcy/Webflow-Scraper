28/04/2020,Fabio Moretti,It would also be helpful for coders... So that you can inspect what exactly webflow does to tweak your custom code. (Which wrappers Lightboxes etc.)
19/03/2019,Miek Thompson,I would love this feature currently I open preview url and then view-source/inspect element but it would be a lot faster to see this within webflow designer without having to switch windows each time.
