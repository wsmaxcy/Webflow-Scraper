21/05/2023,Mario P.,Yes!
24/01/2023,Aditya Pande,My company just told me to create 100-200 websites. This can't get any quicker.
16/09/2022,William Gomes,This will be so useful!
23/08/2022,David A Richardson,I'd like to see this too.  I set up a subdomain for data uploaders that is not suitable for public viewing - more a "back end".  Two sets of cohorts provide the content the public consumes - but it's the same data.  A common CMS just makes sense.
01/02/2022,Keith Greywood,Upvote would be useful for me too
16/11/2020,SH,It's not about the pricing i don't really care if we pay for 2 websites I just need to have one shared CMS for both sites.
16/11/2020,SH,We have 2 brands that cross-promote each other. I need the same database in both of them so basically the only viable option right now is to have my team do the same updates in the CMS two times which is just dumb.
01/08/2020,Ben Gilbert,This would be huge! My use case is that I'd like to start working on a new site based on my same CMS data but I won't be ready to deploy the new site for a month or two and will need to keep adding new elements to my CMS between now and then. I'd like both the current site and the draft of the new site to work off the live data.
26/07/2020,Piotr Bagniewski,upvote
29/08/2019,Meredith Knight,This is becoming a critical issue for us.Â  Would REALLY love to see this.
20/02/2019,Luke Bishop,Personally I would love to see this so I can push the same content to different subdomains.
14/08/2018,Shane,For me personally it would allow me to lower the API processing/requests that essentially update multiple duplicating CMS's across multiple projects/sites.
