24/02/2022,Stuart Bowler,Just chipping in to this wishlist request with an example where I would need this feature now. I have a client who have developed their own API endpoints to access compensation amounts by career specialty and region. Their site is hosted in Webflow and I need to ideally create a secure connection to their external API in order to power a series of widgets that provide interactive interrogation of this data.
