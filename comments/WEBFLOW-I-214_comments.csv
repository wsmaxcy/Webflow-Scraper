17/06/2021,Logan Venderlic,I would LOVE this feature!
26/06/2020,Joe Krug,Hey!

28/02/2020,Alex Aperios,Class additions and subtracts is something i heavenly used in my react projects it would be on the of best things to hit webflow.
19/03/2019,Test Two,any word on this?
19/03/2019,Luka Heinings,This would save so much time. But nothing has happened in two years. (regarding changing classes with interactions) Is there any plans to implement this at all?
03/12/2017,Timothy Perry,Kinda sucks that this has been put in the backlog. I've been holding off on Webflow for one main reason and that is better interactions controls and that includes adding and remove classes.
10/11/2017,Mario Gonzalez,Adding or removing classes this way would be AWESOME and all I need for X-mas. Please move it to in development and you will make all your customers happy. Pleeeeeeeeeeease!!!
07/11/2017,Nathan Huening,"In backlog" booooo
20/10/2017,Tobiah Rex,Is this functionality added in the upcoming Interactions Beta 2.0?
08/08/2017,Alex Zak,pretty please!!
16/05/2017,Kevin Meinhardt,This would be a game changer for interactions. You could store a ton of styling info in a class and then trigger that class using an interaction.. think of fixing a menu on scroll but simply adding the fixed class to the element. THIS WOULD BE AWESOME and save me a lot of manual javascript entry.
11/05/2017,Francisco Aguilera G.,We need this now! :)
