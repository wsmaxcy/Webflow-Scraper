23/05/2021,Shane Rimoro,I don't understand why we can't place JS files on the assets at least with that we could get the absolute path and use that to get the script on our custom code panel and also not have to rely on third party servers just to host JS files! I'm not sure about the security issues regarding this but I don't think its impossible for a relatively large company to  be able to "safe-proof" uploading JS files.
30/06/2020,Dan Guenther,Perhaps the rock solid work around is to marry Webflow and GitHub via API methods.I imagine Webflow has concerns about malicious code that would be executed on their servers and so the entire possibility of this feature as well as user profiles/dashboards is then 0%Would they ever tell us?  Or is it simply called a no-code movement for some reason?The raw potential of the internet capped by bad value promise (IE No-code movement)
08/11/2019,Domenick Basolo,I agree we should have access via a designated FTP to our own individual website. Basically this is the only reason I haven't completely signed up yet. You can designate an FTP to a specific folder and limit access so I'm not sure why it's not allowed. Safer yet would be to edit these files from the backend tool as I'm sure it's encrypted and safer to design this way over and FTP. I'm sure it's because of security reasons but the reality is you can add google tag manager and inject javascript if you really wanted to so there isn't a full-proof way to protect themselves. My opinion is its safer to provide the files rather than having someone trying to figure out how to circumvent the system which can be more devastating.
