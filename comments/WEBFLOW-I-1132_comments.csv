19/08/2021,Danny Figueroa,In trying to understand X-ray mode a bit better I was happy to come across a previous post where you mention it being any to identify padding and margins. I would switch it on and see it go black and white and then switch it off. ðŸ˜‚I love the ideas you have especially with seeing the elements of an image.I think ultimately within reason it would be cool to see a lot of what "Inspect" mode has in browsers.Thanks Vincent for pioneering this topic.
