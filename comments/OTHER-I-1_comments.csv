06/02/2023,James Mouli,Thanks for the detailed explanation
09/04/2022,I Chatterjea,One of my clients asked for this this morning replicating a capacity she had in JotForm  which I used with WordPress prior to migrating and redesigning her site in Webflow.
09/05/2019,Lisa Baker,Alex you seem to suggest this is possible but when I go to the forum link you have listed it says: "Sorry you don't have access to that topic!" Can you help me with how to do this?

18/06/2018,Alex Cheng,This feature is now available. Just check your form settings in your Website's Settings area.
05/04/2018,Zulqarnain Siddiq,I have raised this issue with support several times and they always reply to use zaiper etc.
11/04/2017,Jay Bussiere,It should be from the user and not from webflow when you submit a form. Â  It's not easy to track emails in a mail client software when they are all from "webflow" instead of the "user".
