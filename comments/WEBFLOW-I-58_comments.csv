24/06/2023,Andreas Fasbender,I was considering moving to WebFlow - until yesterday - as I really like the solution pricing and results. For me (sitting in Germany) lack of multilingual support is nothing less than a showstopper. And no I do not consider using a 3PP like Weglot or Bablic for this as the "all-out-of-one-hand" concept of WebFlow is one of its key benefits.
07/06/2023,Philly Phil,It would be amazing were this to have xliff export and import capabilities!
23/05/2023,Anthony Gallego,That would be good
22/05/2023,Martin Stolz,Cant believe its not available. Im quiet angry!

18/03/2023,Stan Govorukhin,When will you ship this? CMS collections without this ability are hard to use.
11/03/2023,Mike,Hey Webflow team any approximate timeframe for when we can expect this and what the v1 capabilities will be? Need to plan whether to fully migrate to Webflow or another platform.

24/11/2022,HYPE Studio,🙌🏻 So glad to see Webflow is having multilingual translation soon!
24/11/2022,Tools Minimum,Hey folks as a Webflow Enterprise Partner we have been faced with clients who say "no" because of the multilingual.That's why we have created a tool for the Webflow community that allows creators to translate their projects into multiple languages.https://polyflow.co
