11/07/2017,Nathan Steele,@admin I know you guys are still in the startup stage...but maybe you either need to hire a few more developers to knock some this stuff out that we as your customers really need and really want or open it up to the community to help flesh some of this stuff out. Whatever the case technology moves fast and it's honestly not fair to makes us wait many months or in some cases years for a greatly needed feature especially if there is no ETA (be it rough or not). Btw deadlines are a good thing...it makes me people get stuff done and most people need them truly myself included :)
10/02/2017,Ray Norris,Thanks for commenting Admin.  I am confident this will foster improved internal practices as well as favor with you customers ...  Posted Anticipated Delivery Dates (Quarter is fine) will be appreciated.
10/02/2017,Ray Norris,ABSOLUTELY - This is a great idea and minimal best practice we should expect.
09/02/2017,Kody Withak,And maybe some progress updates along side with the would be nice. I'd like to know "oh crap Interactions 2.0 is going to take a month longer than expected. We won't see it until June instead." Well  "at least I can plan around that since I'm aware of what is going on".
