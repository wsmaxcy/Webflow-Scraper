06/04/2022,Jarek Lipski,There are plenty of third-party solutions but certainly native solution would be nice.
15/07/2021,Andre Xavier,I need this feature ASAP!!
16/09/2017,Mike Potter,Would be a great idea.  Then perhaps some conditional field options?
12/06/2017,Dean Bajwa,Im searching for same option. This is a MUST in my opinion as multi step forms are something that is essential.
17/04/2017,Samuel Denison,The only ones I have seen you can just blow through them. Would like to see required inputs on questions.
25/01/2017,Graham Cox,Quick follow up. I have seen one or two webflow ninja's create multi step forms using interactions but what I'm talking about is perhaps a new multi-step form block element which auto starts you off with a two step/page form. With an 'Add new step' button to add extra steps/pages as required.
18/01/2017,Diarmuid Sexton,This could be achieved using interactions.
