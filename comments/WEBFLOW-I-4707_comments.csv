14/03/2023,Frank Filipplli,Webflow is REALLY slacking on updates and features over the years. They don't even try ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
09/04/2022,Jayse Hansen,Agree with Kevin and the rest - quick div - and more importantly - quick div-as-parent. Select a div cmd+option+1 and it's the parent of the selected div. This whole adding as the bottom child of selected is so tiresome. 90% of the time that's never what I want.
11/02/2022,Kevin Hannon,We need this immediatly.
28/12/2021,Rosie Way,That would be a great addition pls Webflow <3 add this feature!Currently I'm using command + E and search for div to make it easier!
