11/06/2023,Yoan Basset,huge issue to scale our busines
18/08/2022,Mark Pukita,This sounds like a business opportunity. WebFlow has been unresponsive. Why hasn't someone come up with an integration/add-on to have a "sidecar" CMS that allows unlimited items pages etc?
20/07/2022,Zebra Creative,I'm an agency owner and this and the 100 page limit are really swaying me away from Webflow. It's been a big part of our workflow but this has affected too many of our clients. It's a silly limitation that really makes webflow not work for more than just pretty marketing sites. A real bummer.
28/03/2022,WDY Studio,Please! This limit makes using webflow for ecommerce clients pretty hard.
22/03/2022,Kyle Pflueger,Definitely a silly restriction that makes me not even want to consider Webflow for CMS-based websites when comparing to WordPress or other common CMS leaders.
19/02/2022,David Carroll,Come on Webflow...where is the love? Or at least the feedback? Will this be resolved soon?
15/11/2021,Nathan,Current limit is 60 on business accounts. Unless you're selling t-shirts why would they think that 60 is a reasonable number?? I'm building a travel site with 14 day itineraries and each day has a number of fields. I'm going to have to severely limit the number of items per day because of Webflow not being able to adapt fast enough. What's the point of the CMS if we can't get more than 60 fields per collection? IMO not reasonable and will probably need to leave Webflow because of this one limitation.

10/11/2020,Michaela Arvidsson,30 is way to little and extremely restricted.
28/10/2020,Monique,Same same! I've a limitation of 30 and it's way too little to make my project working. Webflow could you please increase the number of CMS collection fields?
05/08/2020,Nour Beiruti,Hi GuysSo its 2020 and this issue seems to be pending from 2017. It would be great to get some feedback as to if this is something in the pipeline. A limit of 20 CMS Collection needs to be fixed especially with Pro users.
08/07/2020,Yousef Rayyes,This rule is extremely restricitive and makes my client project impossible to implement on webflow. Even the 60 field is too small. I need 120 to make my project work. Such a shame I love using WF and wish i could stick to it for this client.
09/03/2020,Christian Skelton,30 is quite restrictive. I'm trying to use Webflow to build a basic product comparison tool for a client and I'm having to cut data fields to meet the limit. Seems a bit silly really.
21/01/2020,Robert,Increasing the limit from 30 to 50 would be so great! Or even 40... or 35 üòÅ
04/01/2020,Oleg Khalidov,As a freelancer I'm going to do anything to keep my clients from using webflow because of such dummy¬†constraints ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
29/04/2019,Tom Jones,I am currently building a Self-Drive Safari Travel site and am unable to create detailed itineraries within the CMS (there are over 60 itineraries in 12 countries!) - I'm having to cut important info so as to fit the Webflow limit. I think this is an incredibly important feature and will give designers more freedom to develop more information intensive sites.
29/04/2019,Bailey Simrell,Graham Jones nailed this one on the head.
25/04/2019,Zain Burghed,I've upgraded to the biggest plan available - still¬†hitting a wall. UPGRADING DOES NOT FIX THE PROBLEM
05/04/2019,Michael Palana,I'm using CMS for landing pages and need the fields to customize each landing page per vertical. Each vertical has A Hero Image Sub image Title Description CTA and then all its features which could be up to 10 features. IS there a way i can add more fields? i don't care how much it costs! (within reason)
