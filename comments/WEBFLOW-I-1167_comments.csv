29/03/2021,Max Lilley,Very important to add opentype options into the type feature
25/08/2020,Anna Gregory Gregory,I purchase typefaces often for their opentype features. I would like to have access to open type style selection without code. I use it all the time in Figma Sketch and other design tools. This is also a great way to highlight the hard work of the type designers out there.
07/05/2020,Victor Mattoso,Veeeery veeery important!!
21/03/2020,Garrett,Agreed! A web design tool made for designers needs full typographic control!
