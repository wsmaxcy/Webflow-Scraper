29/07/2022,Two Hawks,It would be great to be able to customize the Map element (from Google Maps). Even just a few options like greyscale would be a huge step up.
03/10/2017,Michael Wells,Another commenter mentioned SnazzyMaps.com- I've just tried it and it works far better than expected.  Multiple pins themes cards custom pins... fantastic.
24/01/2017,Sergie Magdalin,Multiple pin for maps is here: https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-141
23/01/2017,Anshu Verma,Very true
21/01/2017,Asaf Lupo,Would be great to be able to pinpoint more than one location on the map and customized the "pin" icon. I had to refuse a project which was supposed to show different projects done/planned in the city.(Maybe this should be an independent item in the wishlist)
