14/06/2022,Guest,+1 — Very disappointed to discover this as we're very seriously trying to get over the "hump" with Webflow preparing to pitch it to a client who is expecting us to build their new site with WordPress. Their team being unable to create pages without delving into the Designer is going to hurt our ability to sell the idea. Boo.
17/02/2022,Matt Rogers,5 years since this was first posted... if there any update? It would seem like a fairly important option to include considering Webflow is attempting to be the alternative to CMS' like WordPress where this functionality is standard. Apparently the 'no-code revolution' doesn't allow my clients to create their own pages.
27/05/2021,Becca Thomas,When trying to sell myself and Webflow again and again I have to explain limitations with Webflow and this is one of the tasks that clients always assume they'd be able to do. And rightly so.

09/05/2021,Matt Rogers,This is one of the main barriers that keeps me from using Webflow for client projects and frustrating to see how long people have been asking for this with no update from Webflow... Back in 2016 the cofounder it was 'on the roadmap' but still nothing! (see screenshot)
17/03/2021,Danny Summers,This is an essential feature for us.  Even the ability to create a static page either by duplicating an existing page or a blank slate but you just select symbols would be very helpful.
22/02/2021,Sean Tubridy,Yeah this is killing my small client business when I want to use Webflow. Non-profits that can't afford a site plan larger than basic have no CMS therefore I can't even give them a new page option through the CMS route.Just the basic ability to pick a template and populate a page would make Webflow so much more powerful. All the animation and interaction updates are awesome but if a client can't make a simple page by themselves what's the point?
29/09/2020,Saeid Babayhosseini,I don't know why they haven't worked on that yet. add this option and me alone would be enough for your marketing as i would be introducing the platform to every one
20/09/2020,Paul Ratchford,I'm not sure where this sits in Webflow's development timeline but it's been a deal killer for me when we sell digital work. I've got IT teams just waiting for Webflow to fail and it's all great till someone says "so show me how someone in marketing can create a page." Followed by "so how do we get the code out of there and into Wordpress."
05/04/2019,Mario Stipetic,Definitely this should be an option
19/12/2018,Jordan Stambaugh,Just running into this with a client today.... It's very hard to tell them "Oh that awesome website I made you that you wanted to manage instead of using Wordpress? Yeah you can't make new pages. I have to do that for you and you have to pay me to do so. Sorry."
14/11/2018,Markus J.,Completely agree. This is a basic need. This is what a client would natuarlly expect to be able to do. Telling them you can't is bad. They's want to be able to do something as 'simple' as adding a new page with a form on it for example. Please add this functionality soon.
30/08/2018,Harald Vogl,YES this should be a must.
10/05/2018,Daniel Cobb,Giving clients the ability to clone a page to create a new one or add a page from a predefined template is a must.
18/07/2017,Louis Reiff,I would love to see this feature too
24/01/2017,Jake V,Yes. This. We need this to compete with the likes of Wordpress. Just identify a page template and go from there.
23/01/2017,Sean Kinney,The ability for clients to create static pages from pre-defined templates independent of collection pages is huge.  They also need to be able to clone existing pages.  This also related to the lackluster method of creating a dynamic navigation bar and the ability for clients to reorder navigation menus (think reordering links listed under a dropdown).
22/01/2017,Otto Berger,makes sense
