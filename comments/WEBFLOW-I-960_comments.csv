28/06/2021,Sofia Pinto Folicaldi,I agree!! In my company we work for many clients at the same time and we would love a Whitelabel editor and not just the CMS.
09/06/2020,Todd Galloway,Agreed.  The Pro feature of "white labeled staging" is misleading. It does not matter if you remove the badge and the logo on the Editor if you are sending your client to a webflow.io domain.
26/07/2019,Shane Wong,I am also a Webydo user and in their system a own-domain.com is assigned so that test-sites does not expose the webflow name neither in the url nor the logo. This is highly important to ensure that clients remain under our care and not go to other designers.
06/08/2018,Calvin Gilfillan,Would love to have this feature!
