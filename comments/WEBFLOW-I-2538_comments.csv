19/01/2023,John T.,This suggestion is way underated. I used to use webflow for my store and absolutely loved the flexibilty of it to create themes. It's THE best online tool to build custom site by far. But it is also extremely limited in ecommerce feature when it comes to do a serious ecommerce opperation (managing orders shipping inventory cashflow analytics marketing etc...) and Shopify is really strong at that.Having the ability to build a theme on shopify using webflow is like merging two super weapons to online commerce owners.
