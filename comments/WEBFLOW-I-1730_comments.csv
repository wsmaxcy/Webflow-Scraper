02/10/2019,Senor Snow,Yes this totally makes sense. It will actually help the aspect of the project management I believe you have focused so much on the aspect of bringing in No Code Design that you forgot about your Dashboard and how it could be way better you guys have the potential to bring what SiteJet is already doing.
02/10/2019,Rendertask Company,We need this! Please!
02/10/2019,Grapheec Creative Agency,Take a look at the way they make it easier for the designers to be organized and how they even provide a client portal. I believe they have powerful tools in project management for websites. Webflow has powerful tools in web design so you guys should just introduce this type of tool to make it simpler and better. If Sitejet did it.. you can too. ðŸ˜€Hope this makes an impact and helps the Webflow community!
02/10/2019,Grapheec Creative Agency,Yes I can't believe how this feature is not on the top of the list. I think it will help designers to be more organized to be able to triple their earnings... which will automatically help us pay for the cost of the subscription on Webflow.
