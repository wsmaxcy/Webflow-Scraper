19/08/2021,Marcelo Velasquez,There is no way to see the real result of VH. This shouldn't be in the wishlist for 4 years.
19/03/2021,Guest,I'm glad by reading your fascinating article also I love this Notre Dame Rudy Jacket Keep uploading more interesting articles.
17/08/2020,Meirion Williams,Could you hack this in by making a 'debug' element/symbol of a horizontal line that you can place on your page  - with position:fixed and then set the v-height at various positions depending on the width breakpoints? Wouldn't be exact but could give rough indication
17/08/2020,Meirion Williams,Should this idea be merged in?
17/08/2020,Meirion Williams,Previewing responsive device height would be very useful. Currently it's a pain having to publish pages and then see them on a real device to get an idea for how much content can be seen on screen.See screenshot for Axure's simple implementation - a dashed line shows the first screen 'fold'.When using the responsive preview the fold line could stay pinned as you scroll the page to show what would be visible on screen.
26/06/2019,Click Click,I am here for the share this nice article getting windows file explorer and have to seen the all folder here.
29/04/2019,Dev Design,My +3 for the preview height option... would allow us designers to create a better UX
10/07/2018,Maxime Duhamel,Hey guys
09/02/2018,Andre Swaby,It's a very important adjustment that should be implemented.
17/01/2018,Collin,My +3 is for the preview height feature.  Preview width is great but not actually that useful if you can't preview height as well.  We need to be able to quickly preview width / height of common device sizes.
16/01/2018,Enrico Niederberger,Im also looking for height preview since I allways have to resize the browser window for checking how the content fits. really makes the work slow and unhandy...
13/12/2017,Colin Hall,While I don't mind being able to see a hover state even in the mobile preview being able to control the height of the canvas so you can see exactly how content will show on-screen would be really helpful particularly on mobile.
19/01/2017,Mark Gilliland,Would be great to preview in not just the device width but also height too.
18/01/2017,Gen Kazak,A good point but there is still possibility of users on a desktop using a small browser window. Hovers on mobile devices don't really matter anyways – the click event happens too quick to notice much.
18/01/2017,Timothy Noah,hmm Not sure Sergie maybe as an option but we'd be assuming all screen sizes on what we call tablet and below will only be using touch. A number of devices now have "air gestures" interactions that involve moving your finger / hand across the top of the screen without touching.
