24/04/2023,Mango Tree,Critical functionality that is preventing people from moving over from other platforms (wordpress shopify) to Webflow.
21/02/2023,Nicolò Padovan,Absolutely crucial functionality that should be implemented as soon as possible.
10/02/2023,Secret Foods,AGREED this is a must pleaseeee WEBFLOW!!! Even if its for "local delivery" like shopify has where you can add postal codes or shipping zones for better rates for those areas - BUT ALL THIS IS A MUST PLEASE PLEASE WEBFLOW :)
05/12/2022,James Skarzynski,
04/09/2022,Jessia Lloyd,Really really need this to be configured! What a nightmare for small businesses!!!
26/04/2022,Stéphane Brais,This is a key issu.  I hope you either open to external shopping carts or resolve to remake your e-commerce backend quickly.
16/12/2021,Tyler Grinstead,This missing feature is a huge driving point for me taking my client's website off of the webflow platform and moving to a hand-built site. Kind of a bummer for my clients as their product shipping rates change drastically from the east coast to the west coast.
05/10/2021,Oleg Gudym,This is a major drawback for our Business since we use USPS cubic shipping rates.
10/09/2021,Nicole Kurrasch,Webflow would be unstoppable if there were some improvements made to ecommerce. As a small business we need the ability to offer free shipping to certain states however with cost of shipping going up we are not able to offer this from coast to coast with Webflow's current shipping set-up. I think it would be highly beneficial to integrate more specific shipping zones specifically from state to state. Please consider this! It would help so many small businesses gain a competitive leg up against Amazon and others.
05/08/2021,Yves-Pascal Mukadi,I'm new to Webflow but I need to admit that this missing feature is a blocking element to move from my current CMS where this is available. Any information on the status of this idea?
17/06/2021,Dillon Schade,In the United States shipping products that contain alcohol have restrictions based upon state. Having the ability to control shipping zones on the state level would allow us to create websites for wineries and breweries.
03/06/2021,Andy Phillips,This is a must have as soon as possible! Every site we build could use shipping by state and we have had to do some crazy work around to gather state info from customer before checkout and adjust pricing by coding the weight.
27/04/2021,Darcy Considine-Moore,Absolutely essential for a florist site I'm currently building. Quite embarrassing.
12/04/2021,Brandon Carver,This is bare minimum in making eCommerce actually work. I feel like you can't actually launch Webflow with eCommerce and claim its production level ready when this ingredient is missing. It's like  a pie missing sugar. Sure there's structure and it looks like a pie but it doesn't taste good. Your comparison chart with Shopify means absolutely nothing if this portion of eCommerce is missing. There should be a bottom box under the comparison chart that says "oh but we forgot that shipping doesn't work..."
05/03/2021,Bogdan Coste,Come on guys it's a crucial aspect.
24/02/2021,Nina Martinez,This is essential! Huge oversight. It costs a to more to ship to Hawaii or Alaska than within the contiguous states. This missing feature actually costs businesses money and should be of priority.
14/01/2021,Vincent Palermo,need this! So important to have this option for small businesses! Please!
28/12/2020,Alborz Heydaryan,Absolutely need this! shipping settings granularity for small businesses is a must. One of my clients plans to hand deliver the product themselves. so there is a majour limitation on the radius and coverage of the shipping area.
15/12/2020,Dkassa Muebleria,Need this for all of my projects this is super important!
12/12/2020,Rebecca Reck,Absolutely need this!  When is it coming Webflow?
