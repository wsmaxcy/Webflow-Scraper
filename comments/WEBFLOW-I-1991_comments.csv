01/06/2022,William WebDev,I am now convinced Webflow implements less than 20% of the features we vote for lol
22/05/2022,Andrej Schulz,Yes. This is much needed and much more practical than Copy-paste or Alt-Drag. Lots of times I already have content in clipboard and it gets lost since I need to use copy-paste. Alt-drag is not that common & practical.Also enable Cmd/Ctrl-D in the side navigator would be very welcome.
