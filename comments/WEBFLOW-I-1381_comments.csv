10/02/2023,Dharmapala Admin,I can't stress how important this feature would be for us. We run many events a day and want them to disappear when they end so that it's clear on our events page what the next event is. I am having to use a zapier + google sheets workaround which is too technical for my colleagues to manage. Could there be an update on when this feature will be added?

19/11/2021,Admin Musikschule,Please!!! Here's an example: I want to be able to filter CMS items that have dates from the years 2015 to 2020. Right now I have to calculate back and readjust the filter settings regularly to achieve this. Thats painful!
29/01/2019,Devin Mooers,+3 for this. I'm trying to hide products that are reserved in someone else's cart (Ticketmaster-style) for a certain number of minutes or hours not days.
