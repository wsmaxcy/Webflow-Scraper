16/06/2023,Benno Ludwigs,This ist so important! We really need more layout flexibility for individual content.
03/06/2022,Lorin Atzberger,This is exactly why I'm not going to buy a yearly subscription. Webflow seems nice but lacks features like crazy. The amount you can do with it is very limited so far.
18/01/2022,Quitos Pangea,Can't believe Webflow hasn't yet integrated this... I'm trying to have a travel blog with multiple images but all I can do is have one below each other instead of side-by-side. Unbelievable.
14/02/2021,Benjamin Kozlowski,Any updates on this?
