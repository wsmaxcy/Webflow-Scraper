23/11/2022,YCP,Currently making a CMS collection of 30 items (our client would like it to be 50 before long) and within each item I believe I'll need to link 2 CMS collections each using multi-reference fields. So I'm currently looking to create 60â€“100 CMS collections which will each be near-identical. Being able to Duplicate CMS collections would be awesome.
23/04/2021,Natalie Russo,Yes I'd like this as well - there have been a few times clients have wanted a lot of the same fields but for a different reason where it doesn't make sense to use reference fields.
