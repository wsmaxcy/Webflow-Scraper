23/06/2023,Cole Schneider,I agree with Jurie's recent comment this is a bit of a deal-breaker for many users. Unfortunately I was unaware until many hours into my site's development and am now at a frustrating crossroad that may lead me away from your platform.
21/06/2023,Jurie Van Staden,Why is the limit so small still? A 4 Mb limit in 2023 is just unacceptable.This post is from 2019. Has anything changed? When will we see an update Webflow?
17/05/2023,Tim Schober,Please fix this asap it's a critical feature for many B2B companies.
17/05/2023,Deko Design,My company is using two main pdf files for listing all our products. These files are each 25 mb. It is ridiculous that the limit is 10 mb. We are currently on the CMS plan but thinking about cancelling the subscription because of this
14/03/2023,Yaroslav Lugovatskyi,4mb that's ridiculous
15/02/2023,Lorenzo Renga,Impossible to make good quality video or assets direct in Webflow
29/11/2022,Matt J,This size limit makes Webflow unsuitable for hosting .pdf's and many business applications. Please expand it to at least 50mb!
09/10/2022,HG Webmaster,Please!
03/10/2022,Tommy,It's hard to take Webflow seriously as an enterprise-grade website solution with a 5mb or even a 10mb limit for assets. Please increase to minimum 100mb and provide plug and play support for video hosting services as well.
23/02/2022,Regan Clack,This definitely needs to be changed to a higher limit even it's behind paywalls for increased sizes.
19/02/2022,Guest,You can host your site with Stacket: https://stacket.app/ where you want and then get unlimited file size upload limit to your needs.
25/11/2021,Kei Maye,For the love of God please increase it to 50mb.
16/08/2021,Seraphim Bakharew,10mb is a really bad joke
03/08/2021,Swastika,50mb is literally the minimum please do this asap!!!!! it's really annoying to not to be able to upload GIFs and good quality images it ruins our websites they look very poor. and all the other features of the website also seems poor then. I need this so much ASAPPP!!!!!!!!!
30/06/2021,Enrico Frascati,That's a joke! I already struggle to understand the 100 pages limit but a 10Mb upload limit is so much 1998. I can send bigger files by email!
29/06/2021,Mark Scholl,10 MB limits for PDF documents is draconian.  I've had a 25 MB PDF uploaded to our website for over 15 years now.
29/06/2021,Arcal Engineering Consultants & Interior Design,Need atleast 50mb limit.
22/06/2021,Dean Newsome,Absolutely essential if Webflow is to be considered a major player. Come on folks listen to your customers :)
27/05/2021,Jean-Fran√ßois Boulay,I would personally settle for 50MB although I certainly understand those wanting a higher limit. Thank you Webflow for considering this and enabling bigger file uploads ASAP.
21/04/2021,Human Baton,Can we get files up to 100MB or more? This is a requirement for our site!
