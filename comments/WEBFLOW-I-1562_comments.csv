25/06/2023,John Asare,I have not tested this but try this workaround.
08/04/2023,Joanna Horvath,We used to have customer pick-up from our old carrier and it was just an option for the customer at checkout.  I am surprised that Webflow does not support this feature.  I we get several request from customers  very frequently about this and our work around is awkward and clunky to say the least..  I truly hope this is something you are working on without going another third party provider.
18/05/2022,Alex Cheng,We still don't have a solution?
20/12/2021,Advisory Team,Yes please can we make this feature ASAP
08/09/2021,Greg Komarski,It would also be great to be able to configure the max quantity for each product by time slot.
22/05/2021,Casen,Would love this!! Please make the time to develop this Webflow!!
21/10/2020,Steven Stavrakis,This also needs to include a date and time selector
21/10/2020,Steven Stavrakis,This needs to exist as of three months ago. Can't use Webflow for restaurants without it.
18/08/2020,Troy Mosby,Between COVID and the destruction of the postal service this is becoming an extremely important feature to have.
11/08/2020,Irina Pistsov,Yes! Many business need it in general but with the Covid situation - it's a hot topic! Store Pickup/curbside pick up option is much requred !
26/06/2020,William D'Aust,need this for Covid situation. Please add ASAP!
12/05/2020,Saul Suaza,WE NEED THIS NOW FOR COVID ¡¡ All my clients are passing by and picking up order in my restaurant.
07/12/2019,Aaron Legaspi,I've also applied the same work around as Alexander. It would also be helpful to be able to reorder shipping methods or pickup locations in the future. At the moment my client has pick-ups on specific dates and it's inconvenient when they add a new date prior to the ones already listed. In this case I need to remove and re-add all the pick-up dates in order for them to be sequentially correct.
05/11/2019,Pete Alexander,Not sure what the status of this item is however this is a key and mandatory feature for ecommerce. One of our recent client a Bakery has a lot of customers picking up orders (e.g. Birthday Cakes etc.) locally and not having this feature is a dealbreaker. There's always Shopify – Store Pickup is a necessity these days for shopping (as witnessed by most if not all retail stores offering this option which is great). Thanks.
02/12/2018,Alexander Miller,Hey AlexI believe this is something they are already working on. For now I've named Store Pickup as a flat-rate shipping method and checked the Free option. When users checkout they can select this as one of the shipping methods. You can even add a description to make it more user-friendly for them.
12/11/2018,Zacchino,This is almost a mandatory for any Eshop. Specially for catering / fresh products.
