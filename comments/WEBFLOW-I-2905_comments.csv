27/10/2020,Koen Ahn,I'd love to be able to set the user-select property natively in Webflow. I have this hero heading text with individually animated words. Because of the way Webflow works I cannot wrap this animation in <H1> tags so I had to create two versions of the heading: one for screen readers that other users cannot see and one that contains the animation that has aria-hidden:true as a custom attribute. So far so good right? But when I select the text on the page and paste it into a text editor the heading shows up twice because both headings have user-select set to default. I want to disable user-select on the hidden heading.
