27/12/2020,Maarten Lodewijk Anne Veldhuijzen,Critical. Now writing everything by hand. Ridiculous.
18/03/2019,Mark Savage,This is essential. As it stands I can't see what changes I'm undo-ing or re-doing and have no idea of the length of undo history.

12/04/2018,Tom Lamers,I second this (photoshop way)
30/03/2018,Kristine Paulsen,Yes please! I wouldn't necessarily need a giant list but maybe the last 20 or so changes would be great to be able to see and access. (Think: what Photoshop can do.)
27/07/2017,Shahab,This would be very useful.
02/03/2017,Studio2bDesigns .com,Personally I think the list of changes in-between backups could easily become quite lengthy and difficult to manage.. However I do think it's a great idea.. Perhaps the ability to simply add "Notes" yourself manually for each backup would be somewhat effective as well? Much easier to implement as well.
