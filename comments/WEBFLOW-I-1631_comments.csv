21/10/2022,Ryan Hale,Because I wanted to have a full sitemap accessible via a Nav Pages collection (that cross-references to Parents/functional groups) I had to manually copy-paste or type the corresponding URLs for each page into the link field. If I change a URL or move a page to a new parent I have to remember to change the link in the collection. Having a dynamic association between the collection item's link field and the acutal page would be a LIFE SAVER for me!!
