12/06/2023,Emily Burnett,Big +1 on this.
02/06/2023,Colin Martin,4 years later and still on v2 - is Webflow still keeping up with development?

11/05/2023,Smokeball Marketing,Please prioritize this!
12/04/2023,Nic Warrington,I have an enterpise client that needs this +1
03/04/2023,Imran Mughal,+1
28/03/2023,Bill MacKay,Throwing my support in for this as well. Desperately needed.
22/03/2023,Dustin Balint,Just adding yet another voice to this. I'm having to choose between getting plagued with spambots or having a very visible and tacky reCAPTCHA box show on all forms. C'mon Webflow—pretty please with sugar on top?
01/03/2023,Dave Cruickshank,Seems quite silly that we should have to vote for a feature like this.  Implementing the latest Recaptcha from Google should be an automatic line-item on the developers roadmap when a new version comes out.  This is a no brainer.  NO ROBOT prompts are passé.
19/02/2023,Ruud van der Linden,Why is this still not implemented?! Why can't your hundreds of employees get something like this done?
18/02/2023,Franco Caporale,I still can't believe this is not available in Webflow. It should be priority #1 we are not in 2005 anymore.
24/01/2023,Ruben Strom,About 100% of users add forms to their marketing websites. I would take some resources from places where fewer than 1% use the service (membership+ecommerce) and use them for improvements that would benefit everyone.
24/01/2023,Maggy Monceaux,Could we make this happen? :D
22/01/2023,Kasan Mantel,PLEASE
18/01/2023,Kyle Taylor,I have clients that are frustrated with me switching them to Webflow because Invisible Recaptcha is not an option.
18/01/2023,Kyle Taylor,I cannot believe invisible recaptcha is not an option.
10/01/2023,Edmond Lo,I use reCAPTCHA on contact and signup forms on a site but I would not want a reCAPTCHA on a quiz form in that I gather user selections only. At the moment I can't exclude one form once I have turned on reCAPTCHA for the site!
10/01/2023,Carolina Amorim,Please please implement this! Recaptcha visible looks horrible in the website!
05/08/2022,Angie,It's 2022 Webflow...this is an absolute must.
29/04/2022,Gunilla De Santo,Hello fellow Webflowers!
