22/05/2023,Eric Smith,I seriously want this too. Currently there is a Chrome plugin called Webflow Collection Reorder that does exactly this I strongly recommend it if it's something you need. But I despise the Chrome browser and hate having to switch to it whenever I need to use that functionality. Would be great to have it natively in Webflow.
