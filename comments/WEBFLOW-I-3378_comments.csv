03/02/2022,Guest,We will create a simple web page with a couple of keyboard shortcuts that will allow users to access some of the website's features. In this second example we will show a help window that will show a list of keyboard shortcuts available on the website. If you visit a certain website frequently you can even create a keyboard shortcut so that every time you click on it your favorite website will open in a browser window. In order to add custom keyboard shortcuts you need to keep track of keyboard keys pressed to keep track of when the desired combination is being pressed.
