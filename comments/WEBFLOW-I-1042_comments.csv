19/02/2022,Guest,You can put your Website now with https://stacket.app/  to GitHub and host there all type of files you want.
06/08/2021,Rhys Dyson,I was just bought a 12 month account plan and spent 4 days rebuilding a prototype of a client site to migrate over from WordPress only to discover it does not support MP3s files one of the most basic of files that has been on the web since the 90's.His entire website is just to host some mp3 sermens and talks about 30-50 minutes each. And it wouldn't be worth buying a small hosting package on top of this when a 5gb server is plenty for the current files he has for just $4 a month.The lack of MP3 support is an absolute deal breaker.
04/11/2020,Webflow One,We really need the ability to upload mp3 files... already two of my customers want to play sounds on their websites but there is not even the possibility to upload a mp3 file with cms... so we use a really unsatisfactory workaround with soundcloud links.
15/06/2020,Lauren Nielsen,Definitely following this thread. I have a need to upload sound files directly (guided meditations). Currently we are working around this by uploading the sound files to our premium vimeo account with an image as the visual then directing users to vimeo to play the file. It's fine for now but obviously could be better. Hope to be able to upload .m4a directly to webflow sometime soon!
28/02/2020,Kevin L√∂ffler,Support for music files is definitely the most important format for me. Even if you have to build your own audio player it would be so much easier to be able to upload mp3 and acc files directly to webflow. Firstly it's a much easier workflow and secondly having all your files in one place is way more manageable and less error-prone.
02/07/2019,Harley Urquhart,Integration would be great i don't think they are commited to supporting audio and¬† would mean you need a second account on another site and have to link to it defeating the purpose of trying to host it yourself .. ie a talent management site where the client can upload audio samples would need a hossting provider to host the files like amazon s3 and the link would have to be stored in your cms. You would also have to update the link if you updated the file making the overhead for the clients a bit too much we need a solution and i agree with @Razel Agustino
23/05/2019,Jos√© Ernesto Rodr√≠guez,üíØ Would be great to be able to upload .vcf files too!
31/01/2018,Daniel Truninger,Yes that's important if client's webspace is webflow too for a project. Often there are some ¬´document archives¬ª needed to be published ‚Ä¶
27/12/2017,Noah Raskin,You can definitely build on Webflow and still host with Siteground. I know because I have Siteground currently. This being the case you can easily upload your mp3 files to your server via FTP (Filezilla) or even directly in your cPanel. Siteground has great support and if you don't know how to do this you can hit them up in a chat on the support page.
