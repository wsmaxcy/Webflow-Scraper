14/09/2018,Madeleine Xanthine,Thank you for saying this.  I can understand not allowing illegal content but webflow's restrictions are judgmental and puritanical.  I can understand laws like this in their hosting (though that's also ridiculous but it's their house) but restricting what you do with a tool once you've bought it?
11/04/2018,Patrick s.,I'm with winter teller on this.
14/07/2017,Sstrantz,I agree with Vincent and Scott.  Ethical and trustworthy and good reputation is a top priority and should continue to be.  So - voting to keep the exclusions.
11/07/2017,Scott Van Zandt,You can literally build anything you would like with the platform just nothing with the following themes. I've built over 50 Websites using Webflow and have never had to even double check the terms. Unless your planning on building an agency off of offensive or profane websites then there is no reason to be disappointed. I don't even accept any work with Adult Themes Profane or Religious themes and I've only had to turn down 1 project. I think this is common practice for most ethical and trustworthy agencies taking the Web seriously. If Webflow became the platform for Adult Themes to be built on it would risk tarnishing it's reputation as well as the communities.
11/07/2017,Vincent Bidaux,It's not ridiculous it's common practice. You're a bit rushing into conclusions.
