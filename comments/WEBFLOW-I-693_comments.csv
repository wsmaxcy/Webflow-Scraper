13/01/2021,Sam Pierce Lolla,This missing feature was really noticeable when moving a blog from Medium to Webflow
26/08/2020,William Albright,This would be great to have.  For now I have to insert a code block for each <hr> - this  a bit clunky.
14/10/2019,Des Tapaki,Any update on this or work around. Tried adding in SVG line image and it wont display.
14/03/2019,Olga Sko,Also vertical line would be great!

14/05/2018,Charles Gerli,We need this. Sounds like a quick win for Webflow.
11/04/2018,Scott Stephens,I know I asked this on the Q&A with Vlad and Nelson but I would LOVE to have this soon!
20/03/2018,Scott Stephens,I would love to have the ability to throw an <hr> into CMS rich text for blog posts. ¬†Any ETA on this? ¬†I've seen it in the forums as a request as well. ¬†Thanks!
01/02/2018,Snapper Cridge,Seriously five votes? This one isn't a hard one and is essential for separating collection content that has a rich text field.
07/07/2017,Kate Hsu,I would love to have that feature too. Thank you.
