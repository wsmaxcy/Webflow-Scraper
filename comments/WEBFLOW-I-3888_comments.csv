11/10/2021,Brent Neale,It's great to see 'reviewed' on items in the wishlist - but it would be so much more beneficial to know what the outcome from the review is (is it likely to be backlogged rejected etc) or just to know where Webflow's priority areas are in terms of the road map!
01/02/2021,Brent Neale,yes please!
