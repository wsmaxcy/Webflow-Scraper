17/05/2017,Philip Marklew,Hi Sergie Yes it would be nice to be able to click on each row in the table of form submissions and see the complete data for each column. Sort of like a mini email client (minus the ability to respond). This would be very useful for the less tech savvy clients of mine who seem unable to ever find an email in their outlook I could just point the in the direction of this section of the editor to see all of their website emails.
17/05/2017,Webflow Team,Philip can you provide more info? What do you mean you can't see the form submission? Do you mean being able to see all columns and all the data in each column?
