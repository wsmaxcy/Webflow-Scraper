06/05/2022,Aumadi Technologies,Customers in India are only put off by the limited options for payment gateways available on Webflow Ecommerce. There needs to be an integration available with Razorpay/PayU/Paytm
03/11/2021,Kasseyy Sk,Adding square as an option to take payments would allow users to use vidmate  square instead of stripe or paypal.
12/12/2020,Nikhil More,Yes please! Webflow and shopify are priced neck to neck but webflow doesnt have the support in terms of payment gateway integration in India. This needs priority.
