26/05/2023,Florian,+1 to this. A big CMS is SO important for any site with articles and 10k items are barely enough for 3-5 years at max.
18/05/2023,Zac Hardman,Webflow does not seem to be focussing on this as an issue as it only has 600 votes. Its a classic case of survivorship basis where its only collecting information from people who stay on platform. I have spoken to so many people who won't touch webflow due to the CMS limits. Can we please get additional CMS allocation at $X per month?Its crazy that people are leaving wordpress build on webflow hit 10K and go back to wordpress. This will be me in a few months :(.
08/04/2023,Kate McMahon,Webflow can you fix this already. I often have to use embeded code as I work around since I am often limited in what I can do with Webflow CMS collections which I don't mind... but now I discover a 10000 limit so I have to do a work around for my work around... this is just getting silly! Fix this already!!!
26/02/2023,Mario P.,WB. Please give us an update.
25/01/2023,Dana Asper,I cant believe this doesnt have the most votes!! Come on people vote it up!! Also --- I would like to repeat Kasper's comment / question below: "@Webflow was this left open because you're still testing out things?
04/11/2022,Ahmed Abdeen,My website is a small sports news website. We have 31K articles and 15k tags in addition to authors and categories. We are planning to create custom posts for players and teams; this is alone more than 50K items.
30/10/2022,Kasper Dam,@Webflow was this left open because you're still testing out things?
28/09/2022,Greg Pinto,We are moving off Webflow because of this. No answer? No plan to increase? How??
06/09/2022,Baltazar Fajto,It's super easy to go past 10 000. It should have been lifted a long time ago even more with the memberships around the corner
23/08/2022,Jason Greenwald,This should be the #1 priority at the company It limits ALL use cases.
17/08/2022,Adalberon Castello,Please üôèüôèüôèüôè
16/08/2022,Miguel Madrid,Absolutely ridiculous that not even Enterprise has more than 10000 cms items. Get your shit together.
15/08/2022,Jesse Foy,This is a big concern as it will soon force us to find another service. We do not want to do this after all of the time and resources put into Webflow. Please make this a high priority. Thanks!
09/08/2022,Ann Jenkins,it needs to be unlimited. like all the other companies.
29/07/2022,Project Production,Literally the last feature I've needed for about two years now :( For a platform that pioneered the most practical visual web dev software then integrated ecommerce I'm really surprised this hasnt gotten more attention. Maybe atleast partnering and providing more info on integrating cms pulls from other platforms so I can sealmleslly scale without exporting webflow site would be cool..
28/05/2022,Brandon Fertig,Yikes. All these years and still lacking.
12/05/2022,Amber Kristine,
28/04/2022,Peter,Sigh... 10k is nothing for CMS. All other platforms provide unlimited CMS items. Webflow doesn't seem to listen to their customers. This will more than likely cost them in the long run.
07/04/2022,Greg Pinto,It looks like Webflow is rolling out new CMS updates but still no word on this?
06/04/2022,Rene,Totally agree.... we have had multiple use cases where we would have loved to move clients onto webflow but a 10000 item limit prevents us from doing so. Someone didn't think this one through enough when they create the CMS as it limits use cases for Webflow. This should be a priority feature.
