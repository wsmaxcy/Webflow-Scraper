20/11/2022,Finn,Not a full solution but in my case I just wanted to check out a new post on the staging site (xxx.webflow.io) without posting to the main site. You can do that by changing the post to "Staged for publish" in the Editor and then publish the whole site to just one domain via the Designer.
01/04/2022,Red Letter,Please address this!
17/03/2022,Ben Schweitzer,Seriously how is this not fixed yet?
31/01/2022,Caleb Peffer,THIS ISSUE ISN'T JUST A LIMITATION ITS A LANDMINE.
31/01/2022,Caleb Peffer,The current system made me look bad in front of a client.It's unintuitive in the worst way. THIS SHOULDN'T have taken 4 years to improve. I can't justifiably recomend webflow after this.
28/08/2021,HYPE Studio,This should be avaliable in Editor as well...
26/07/2021,Christer Persson,For others that stumble into this huge deficiency in the editor another user on the forum over at https://discourse.webflow.com/t/published-by-editor-also-publish-my-staging-design/63483/9 actually came up with a stop-gap solution/css-hack to avoid this HUGE headache until webflow solves this natively... add this to the head of your site - it removes the publish button completely. <style>
29/01/2021,Dan,This is probably the #1 deficiency with Webflow.
27/01/2021,VOUS Web,Any update on implementing something to solve the issue of Editors publishing changes meant for staging to live/production? Can we give them a choice like in the designer?
12/06/2020,Erik Ponnert,I concur there has to be a separation with the publishing of the work carried out in the Designer as opposed to the Editor. I see that this request has been active for a long time and this is a much needed functionality and should be introduced sooner rather than later.
07/04/2020,Thilo Wolter,This is a very important issue and actually makes us consider switching away from WebFlow because our editors keep accidentally publishing mid-work changes from my design process causing horrible bugs on the live site. Until an advanced rights management for editors is implemented I think the "publish" option for editors should be removed and make "publish selective item" the standard option because this is what everybody is expecting anyway!
12/03/2020,Matt Brodersen,I made the decision to move my company's website away from WordPress to Webflow. I'm actively in the process of moving our blog into the Webflow framework as part of our corporate domain. I need the ability to publish certain pages and CMS collections selectively. Currently I do one weekly push on our corporate site  and many times there are pages on our site that take a few days to finalize and test before pushing live. The blog will sometimes have three posts per week that will need to go live. This is going to cause some major issues. Please get this feature implemented.
30/09/2019,TRUE,Is this really how it works?!?! If editors want to publish their changes they have no choice other than publishing all changes by anyone else? That sounds crazy!
15/07/2019,Law Creative,This should absolutely be a standard feature...
11/07/2019,Michelle Sue Agee,We just found a workaround (Poetic Systems). To have selective publishing
08/04/2019,Carson Thetford,This should be in the backlog quickly! It's almost pointless to have editors if you can't keep the design work separate from their work.
27/03/2019,Matthew Daines,This is a major deal breaker for multiple editors. It does not make any sense to allow multiple editors in the system if their edits are not their own.
28/01/2019,Xavier Massaut,Same situation for us. We have just migrated an important customer to Webflow. Confident after our first tests and reading documentation on publisher features that it enable-led publication of content from the publisher to both platforms - Staging and production - as does the designer part. We discovered shortly before our first release and delivery to the client that this was not the case. Worst! An editor can push design changes live from the editor part without anyone being warned.
28/01/2019,Caroline Sober-James,This is really really important -- not sure how it's not a standard feature. Also seems similar to this request: https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1246.  Just ran into this with a client where he made some CMS changes in the Editor on staging for a new set of pages and published them not realizing (I didn't realize either) that he was publishing the pages that weren't necessarily ready for production yet. Luckily in this case the change was low-risk but this could be a huuuuuge deal. Please implement publishing targets for the collaborator or a "Do not publish" flag on pages for the Designer.
13/01/2019,Eric NIshioka,agreed! this make it super hard to maintain a site that is constantly being updated by multiple authors
