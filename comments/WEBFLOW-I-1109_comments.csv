29/09/2022,Taha Zemmouri,I'm in the process of canceling my account over this missing functionality (too)
24/08/2022,Tim Trautmann,I'm in the process of canceling my account over this missing functionality. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
28/12/2021,Ågot Hellum,Another vote for this. Is it possible to get feedback from Webflow if this basic blog feature will be fixed?
06/12/2021,Inge Cuypers,Yet another vote for this. We are stuck publishing on a very static schedule that doesn't allow for much flexibility at all. The manual management of featuring articles in order of importance not original staging is also not very efficient. So please please can we get this dating feature soon.
22/10/2021,Design Team,Another vote for this one... I should be able to set a publish date manually... whether it's in the past or the future! I understand you can use a custom field but that's an irritating and error-prone workaround. Would be a lot easier if the "Published Date" defaulted to the current date or the scheduled date or could be overriden with a manual value.
23/04/2021,Guest,Thanks for sharing this post with us! We need to migrate our old business content to a new website therefore it would be really useful in case of input in date. I have been working as a senior staff at  https://snowremovalschaumburg.com/and help people with snow removal project during winter season.

09/04/2021,Tor Vegard Tobiassen,I'm currently transferring content from an old site to webflow. And this was such a basic future to me that I thought for sure that this was possible. Please add this function.
06/11/2020,Garrett R,The response that we could use a custom field date ignores the reality that transitioning a site from another CMS this is hugely impractical due to the manual nature of the process - as others have already said. It seems basic please just make the creation date an editable field. i.e. just auto add the existing date field please.
27/07/2020,David,Just posted a request for pre-populated date fields which would be a nice-ish solution to this – https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-3160
27/07/2020,David,This is a real big one as someone else said – this falls apart when importing a bunch of old entries. Manually having to add the date on every post is... not nice. I'm guessing this is a technical limitation somehow but being able to manually select the published date would also negate the need to have the schedule feature.
08/06/2020,Matt Schweitz,Not sure why the benefits of this feature are such a mystery. When I import posts into Webflow sure I can manually set the dates for a new custom field (ie "Original Publish Date") but THEN for all new future posts my authors have to manually set this field as well. This shouldn't be required in any modern CMS system. Please fix.
08/06/2020,Kylee James,error code 43 disney plus can occur due to many reasons few of the factors can be its settings network connectivity or at times it can be an overloaded server. It has gained tremendous popularity in a short time still there are some issues people encounter like.
05/05/2020,Michael Auer,This ist SUPER important and a BASIC Feature of a CMS… i Never saw a cms who doesn't support edit publish date until webflow. why?
16/03/2020,Tye Newton,This is important! Great points have already been in this thread as to why a custom Date field is not a sufficient workaround incuding that it causes a ton of extra ongoing work when the ability to edit the Publish Date would only take some work one time. We also shouldn't have to take up one of a limited number of CMS fields just to correct an issue caused by importing CMS items in a way that doesn't honor the original Publish Date.
04/12/2019,Yasmina Lembachar,Yes! This post also provides more feedback as to why a custom date field wouldn't be practical: https://forum.webflow.com/t/editing-publish-date-for-imported-cms-items/100385 (namely: the need to then manually update the field for every new post added to the collection)
07/10/2019,Keira Buckley,An enormous advantage to a CMS like Joomla is the network of prepared designers it has taking a shot at augmentations and security fixes for it.
11/07/2019,Ashwin Kumar,You know the control panel is a section of Microsoft Windows that enables a user to change various computer hardware and software features restore control panel in windows 10 follow this online tutorial to learn more usages.
17/05/2019,Gustav Kjellin,I think I can provide a fairly valid use case unless I'm missing something obvious:
09/02/2018,Diarmuid Sexton,Yes a custom date field will work in all those cases. You're right - it's not really necessary!
