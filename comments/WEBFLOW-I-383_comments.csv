02/10/2021,Dean Russell,can you link webflow form data directly to webflow cms?
20/03/2017,Luke Preiner,The Zapier integration is great but not quite what I'm looking for.  It seems wasteful to use (and potentially pay for) Zapier just to copy the form submission data that Webflow already stores to another system.
11/02/2017,Graham Cox,Webflow integrates with zapier.  Would that do the trick?
