09/09/2021,Webflow Admin,Hi there! Great idea and thank you so much for sharing this request. Has your team tried using our conditional visibility feature to show/hide different sections on dynamic pages based upon the name of the collection? Many of our customers have achieved what you're hoping to build with this feature. Though I'd like to understand if this would help resolve the issue or if you're looking for something different.
