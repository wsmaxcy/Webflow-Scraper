18/04/2023,Kin Chi Cheuk,omg already 6 year…..this feature too important…..my client don’t understand why no multiple editors….
31/10/2021,Simon Wachtler,Very important for bigger clients with multiple editors!
06/07/2021,Marget Long,SUPER IMPORTANT if we are to adopt Webflow for a large college site.  We have multiple stakeholders/editors/contributors and the current limitations in access permissions and restrictions preventing us from using Webflow as our CMS.  Would love to replace Drupal but so far does not look like Webflow is the right tool for large site with multiple editors especially lay-people whom are not going to learn the designer.

10/03/2020,Andres Herrera,This is important. For example I don't want the client to access SEO Settings on a page a poke around.
23/01/2019,Ziga Krampersek,Agreed it's totally ridiculous that this is not possible basically editor access means superadmin access :/// PLEASE work on this its preventing us to pay for more webflow hosting plans
09/01/2019,John Columbo,This is super important as I would like to offer my clients a custom editing experience where they only have access to change certain collections or page content. The client becomes frustrated when they are not sure if they are going to mess something up and they only want to change one or two things on their website like a menu or blog. I (the developer) lose time and money if they do mess something up and I need to fix it for them.
