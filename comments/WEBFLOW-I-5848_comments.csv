14/03/2023,Frank Filipplli,I understand that you can use Ctrl+E or Ctrl+K but both options are terrible. Ctrl+E comes with many of the drawbacks I already mentioned above and as a second option I can't think of anything worse than Ctrl+K. Besides the fact that Quick doesn't start with the letter K Ctrl+K is just a terrible shortcut for anything really. It is WAY TO FAR from the Ctrl key forcing you to always use 2 hands to execute. Which is why I recommended at least adding a option for Ctrl+Q because it is not used for anything solves a lot of these problems and also serves as the actual first letter in the word "Quick". It makes so much sense and is a rather simple change. But you've clearly ignored all of the points I've laid out in this feature request and responded with unhelpful nonsense to subdue my input. This is why so many people are dissatisfied with Webflow as a company mediocre customer support. Good product bad team. ðŸ‘Ž
