05/03/2021,Jérémy Jean,Any news on this? Thanks
02/02/2017,Marcel Deelen,Whoooo yes yes. Any idea about the release date for 2.0? Would also be nice to get invited into the beta testing group. BTW webflow is amazing been doing ever more complex websites in it and it safes me a huge amount of time and makes life as a digi designers a whole lot more enjoyable.
01/02/2017,Trevor Whittingham,When is Interactions 2.0 due again? I also agree with Marcel that the ability to target IDs would be much more efficient.
