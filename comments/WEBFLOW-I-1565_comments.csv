05/09/2022,Andrew Rogers,There were requests on your previous feedback page back in 2016 to fix this. Any ETA?
26/05/2020,UMS BOATS,This is totally needed option. After 2 hours work I've lost all the changes..... please... add this feature to the editor mode or in the project settings to set up the autosave time range.
06/07/2019,Desmond Bowe,please please please add autosave to the CMS editor.  I just lost hours of work because I didn't click Save Draft.  Most online editors do this automatically these days.  thank you
28/11/2018,Mikhail Miroshnikov,Is there at least a shortcut for saving?
