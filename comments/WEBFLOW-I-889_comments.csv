17/01/2019,Kevin Brand,Wouldn't sharing one Webflow account (as in sharing login information) be the solution for this? As long as you trust your work partner? That way you can work from the designer and the content maker uses the editor. You could even share the costs of having said Webflow account.Or you could try contacting Webflow (support) directly and pitch them the idea that an optimized workflow would increase the number of sites you ship that way they might give your account and only yours that one content editor that you need. You loose nothing by asking.
