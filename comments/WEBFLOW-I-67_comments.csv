07/06/2020,James Wee,This needs to be top priority. Can we prioritise this please?
13/02/2019,Kyle kimberlin,Please I love webflow as a designer but not being able to seamlessly integrate with front-end developers and not being able to import code back into webflow is a deal breaker for using it with my company. Unfortunately is making me look into other options such a sitejet.com if you could just add code editing similar to them I would be so happy as I would finally be able to fully integrate it into our work environment.
20/01/2017,Eric Potratz,This request should be merged with this one: https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-42
20/01/2017,Eric Potratz,Yes it would be very helpful to see custom code live in the designer!
18/01/2017,Antonio Balderas,The style tag is good for a few lines of code but for large chunks of code a editor in webflow  that put the code inside the css stylesheet will be nice also a toggle switch to enable js in the designer!
18/01/2017,Martin,I agree although I'd like to see the things this is usually used for implemented first :) (eg pseudo classes breakpoints...)
18/01/2017,Matthew Sanderson,I hadn't thought of a debug URL with auto refresh – that could work!
18/01/2017,Gen Kazak,…or maybe some kind of debug url that has auto refresh?
