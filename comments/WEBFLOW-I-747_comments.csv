08/08/2017,Cameron Roe,+1 I agree. I would like to see more of a Medium-style editor with larger font more editing options and the ability to add code blocks. It would also be nice to toggle between a Standard Editor and Markdown mode. I'd like to write my posts purely in Markdown and have the format maintain.
