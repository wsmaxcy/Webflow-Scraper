25/01/2019,Michael Wells,Very keen. I think in order to support SVG CSS though we have to treat it differently from images and embed it inline.Â Â This is needed for currentColor to work as well as xlink clickable areas.Â  I've added a wishlist item here for an SVG Element in webflow so these types of things can be controlled.
23/01/2019,Maximilien Bony,I'm new webflow user and spent too much time looking for how custom css for my svg files. It could be very (very) usefull !
