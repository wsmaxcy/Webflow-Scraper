16/06/2023,Jasin Idrissi,Did anybody try to integrate it using Webflow Logic? Or other tools like Zapier or Make.com?
22/05/2023,Matthias Solberghe,Massive blocker here for Belgian clients I have. People here simply don't have or use credit cards we only use Bancontact.
25/10/2022,Miel Pannecoucke,Please make this work! otherwise it's almost completely useless to build webshops with Webflow here in the Benelux
27/07/2022,Thomas,Hi Webflow team This is truly a must for all European customers of the platform. I'm a newbie to the platform and use it for Ecommerce. Never have I suspected the crucial importance of our loyal payment gateway. An integration would provide all potential European customers with a familiar payment gateway using debit (almost all local banks supported) Creditcard Apple Pay Afterpay Cryptocurrencies Coupons Ã¡nd Recurring/Subscription payment options. We already received payment gateway related requests by our loyal customers and this can only become worse. Please please open up a dialog with Mollie. They are a relatively young company with an advanced (and quick) developer team. This would also bring more European customers to start using Webflow so it would truly benefit all parties involved. Thanks!
14/07/2022,Maarten Bennis,And while you are at it implement the recurring payment features Mollie support.
07/02/2022,Sync Development,This is a must!
24/01/2022,Ben Roggen,yes!
04/01/2022,Wesley Botman,As an agency we would build all of our e-commerce websites (for dutch companies) in Webflow if Mollie was supported. Or fix the ideal support for Stripe so we could use that.
22/12/2021,Project Lala Salama,Yes pleaseee
10/11/2021,Say,This is a must for europe payments. If this is possible the growth of use of webflow will insignificantly grow..
19/09/2021,Jonathan Beijersbergen van Henegouwen,
03/07/2021,Tom,What does the status "Reviewed" means? Does this mean this idea will be impletemented soon?? Would be great - WE LOVE MOLLIE.
10/05/2021,Jaap van Houtum,We would like to build the integration between Webflow and Mollie. If there are people from Webflow that read this forum I would be happy to get the conversation started.
19/01/2021,Soil,Please fix this as soon as posible...
30/11/2020,Josse Marchoul,Want this so bad
27/11/2020,Zavala,I just don't understand how this is taking so long.
03/10/2020,Marlies van Gelder,Yes please! This is the only thing holding me back using webflow for all of my clients. We need Mollie :)
03/10/2020,100xspreadsheet X,This is absolutely mandatory to succeed in EU / Benelux.
28/07/2020,Unreel Agency,Important i had do decline webflow because clients use mollie!
25/07/2020,Ahmed Jaama,I do not  understand why molie or ideal  has not been incorporated yet.Most importantly why is it taking so long.I really would love to use Webflow.It is  really disappointing finding out that can not offer e-commerce webflow sites wihout molie or ideal.
