30/04/2019,John Murdock,I know this is an old topic but I am going to revive it. I agree with Carolee. There are some interactive tutorials such as "Creating a Custom Portfolio." The problem there is that the tutorial (and the rest of them) doesn't match the current UI. IMHO it was a big mistake to launch the new UI before updating the tutorials. This has led to infinite confusion and frustration for newbies like myself and my business associate who are trying to learn.Yesterday I just had to give up on learning how to use the software because watching the tutorials and trying to guess my way through it was a waste of time. I was ready to buy a hosting plan but that ain't gonna happen until I can find reliable instruction that matches the current UI. One comment I saw suggested that I could go on learning it because only the UI had changed—ridiculous! The UI is what one has to learn and if the tuts don't match it they are virtually useless.Regarding Carolee's comment that the videos go by quickly. That's and easy fix: just choose 75% or 50% speed to play them on Youtube preferences. Of course that doesn't help much if the tut doesn't match the UI.
