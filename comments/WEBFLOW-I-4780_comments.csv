26/03/2023,Mario Garcia,I am happy that they remove the restriction of unhusted sites for example you can only have 2/10 active pages in the basic plans like free or freelance it would be great to have several sites and only count the active ones that are published.
27/03/2022,Robert Holtz,So you want Webflow to pay the salaries of a bunch of people keep a bunch of cloud server infrastructure running 24/7 support personnel and software developers and you want all of it for nothing? Plus you want all your projects to run for free (i.e. at Webflow's expense) even if they hog up all kinds of resources? Give a thought to what you're requesting and please be reasonable. I am not trying to troll you but honestly do you really think any company in their right mind is going to just give this all away so you can have a free sandbox and have everything for nothing?
