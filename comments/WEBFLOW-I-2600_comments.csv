10/11/2021,Tristan Jacobs,Same here I have payed the R 700 cost  now I cant even add stripe I have to use paypal  for checkout and this is a big no no for my clients  no I cant swop to a another webbuilder cuz i have payed it already  i really hope webflow could add this like today  but i guess they dont care about us shouth africans. I really Love webflow this is the best website builder out there but that one flaw costed me a client  and now i  have to pay the costs myself :( Webflow really has the potential to please everyone and I really dont know what they have't added this yet.
10/07/2021,Jarrod Bischoff,I'm a South African living in the UK and have been building websites in the UK and love Webflow. I have an e-commerce vape and tobacco brand in South Africa that is doing well but needs a major facelift. My first option would be Webflow but there is no working payment gateway option that I can link the site to. Therefore I'm going to have to revert to the clunky but still workable WordPress option. I'm not the only South African who loves Webflow but cannot even contemplate going down this route because of the lack of payment options available. PLEASE 'PULL FINGER' AND PARTNER WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE PAYMENT GATEWAYS! Thanks.
19/06/2021,Ruan Demeyer,We need a more convenient method just waiting patiently.
14/04/2021,Terence Absolon,Hi  would a webflow template work if I used it with a South African domain name? (co.za)
09/02/2021,Quentin Viljoen,Please Webflow help with this.
06/11/2020,Carey Slade,This is a serious reg flag for me. Not only are the upfront setup fees for Stripe Atlas just ludicrous for the develeping market but to make it worse there are additional annual fees and taxes that make this a completely unviable option for us in South Africa. Please integrate Paypal asap!
09/08/2020,Michael Viljoen,I don't understand why Stripe was chosen exclusively leaving out the developing world where we really need these solutions.
01/07/2020,Dylan Cox,Please make available for SA. This is the only reason i'm more drawn to SquareSpace! This is desperately needed - all my marketing colleaugues and I often mention this.
08/06/2020,George Ikem,Same for Nigeria.
