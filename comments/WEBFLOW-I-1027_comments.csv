01/04/2022,Paul Walsh,Yeah it would be amazing if you could copy the collection template with the collections unbound and ready to plug into new collections.
26/02/2021,Mohamed mahdi Khemiri,Whould love to see this
01/10/2020,Drew Eastmead,This is highly needed. A huge time waster. Not surprised to see that this has been on the wishlist for 3 years now. What is the point of having a wishlist if things just sit here for YEARS?
10/03/2020,Klaudia Bachinger,Especially since some elements stay bound without any apparent bindings being active which only leaves you with the option of deleting them. Highly frustrating.More complex designs also suffer more from it.
26/03/2018,Trevor Whittingham,I would LOVE to see this functionality
