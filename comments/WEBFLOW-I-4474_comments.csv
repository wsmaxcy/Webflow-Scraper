14/12/2022,Kimber Severance,I would love to be able to schedule updates.
29/09/2022,Ethan Baldwin,H/T to this suggestion as I just came in to post the same. I use Collections to house various information sources on a site (e.g. Site Location Info FAQs Event Info) and the information is often updated on particular schedules or launch dates (e.g. Location A is changing business hours on X date). It would be amazing if scheduled posting was expanded to existing posts as it allows us to pre-load known updates. Currently we have to wait until the time/date of the update (which can sometimes be middle of the night).
