16/08/2018,Jack Vaughan,I use Vimium the chrome plugin. This allows me to browse the web by pressing f and seeing all the 'clickable' items on that page by highlighting them on the screen each with their own temporary shortcut. You then click that shortcut (usually a combination of asdfjkl; characters like 'FS' or 'KS') and it selects/clicks that item.
10/04/2018,Jonathan Friedman,Add up/down arrow keys to navigate the page/asset/cms panels. Short cut to open panels is useless if you then have to mouse around the panel to get anything done ;-)
