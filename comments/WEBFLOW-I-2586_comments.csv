26/06/2023,Emanuel,I was built my first Webflow ecommerce site and spend hours trying to get live shipping rates with Shippo only to discover that Webflow does not allow Shippo rates to show live rates on it's website. I talked with a Shippo representative and they said Webflow is blocking it. Shippo provideds live rates for other ecommerce platforms but they are at the mercy of Webflow. So disappointing to that live rates don't work. Please Webflow get this feature turned on.
22/05/2023,Sean Connelly,This just bricked us on a site launch ðŸ« We have a client with multiple sites we're migrating into Webflow one of which is an ecommerce store. Though we initially wanted to use Shopify for their ecom site we agreed to use Webflow on all the sites for max consistency. We mistakenly assumed auto-calculating shipping at checkout was a feature on Webflow. Although it's a very simple store with only one shipping option (UPS Ground) his packaging is slightly too large to use UPS Simple Rate. Shipping locally vs. to other states creates up to a $100 variance in the cost of shipping and there's no way for me to accommodate this using Webflow. The Squarespace site we're migrating away from calculates the shipping easily. I'm not even sure what to do as a workaround aside from convince our client to either overcharge for shipping or accept a lower margin on sales.
01/02/2023,Rami Abdi,Man shipstation literally made its own webflow integration because you guys took forever.
24/10/2022,Scott Bergman,I'd also love to hear a timeline on this. This seems essential for an eCommerce site to handle.
16/08/2022,Anthony Kuenzi,My research brought me here. Also running into a road block where a small volume client needs a more accurate way of calculating shipping. Any updates on when live shipping options will become available in the cart?
17/06/2022,Leo Batger,Has this been evolved on at all? Absolute disappointment from my end as this is a huge headache not being able to give people exact pricing on shipping and having to do 100% guess work around this.
25/02/2022,M-A Lavoie,This is a game breaker for my client. I worked hard to convince them to switch to Webflow and I'm now at a standstill. When can we expect this ?
14/04/2021,Saje Damen,shippo does not work in Canada when can I integrate Canada Post? Had I known how difficult this basic thing is...
07/02/2021,Matthew Ochoa,Whats the status of this?
04/01/2021,Jeff Lloyd,Live shipping rates is pretty much a given on any respectable eCommerce site. The Webflow advertising is deceiving around this topic. The marketing seems to indicate live shipping rates upon checkout is already a feature and currently it is not.
21/12/2020,Logan Hawkins,Thisss!!!! ^^^^^^^^^
04/05/2020,Jason Katsoris,Now that shippo is integrated softly what might be the timeline on this?
