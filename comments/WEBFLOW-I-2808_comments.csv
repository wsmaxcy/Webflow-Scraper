07/06/2023,HG Webmaster,Any update on this? A timeline for development?
01/06/2023,Jonas Bannwart,Dear readers Dear Webflow team
13/04/2023,TwoFive Squared,Please make this available!
15/03/2023,Lukas Schorn,Issa must!
08/03/2023,Adriano Resende,The marketing team here and client are annoyed that they cannot change the link on the image.
07/01/2023,Dario Villirilli,I want to add a link to some images I add directly in the editor and I can't. I can only add the alt text. :S How is this not an option?
13/11/2022,Niels Bakhuis,Indeed why is this still not a thing?
16/08/2022,Grdesigner 2,we need it....
09/08/2022,Denis Mokin,Please! its essential 99 precent of the time i use costum buttons why the client need me to chane a link? thank yo webflow
08/07/2022,Ollie Law,Client: Hey can we edit this button link and text please?Me: No...Client: Um...OK. Why not?Me: I have no god damn idea.
25/05/2022,Jeff Karnes,This is for sure a must have for handing projects off to clients.
03/05/2022,Philipp Roth,here is a solution from finsweet: https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/edit-link-blocks-in-editor
30/04/2022,Jonathan Morin,C’mon man!
09/03/2022,Michael Nöthiger,This is a must-have!
05/03/2022,Lukas Jurcik,This is way overdue..
14/02/2022,Dale Gruber,would be SUPER useful!!
01/02/2022,Gordon Dowling,Absolutely crucial basic functionality. Stupid decision to remove it.
12/12/2021,Alain,Yes this would complete the user experiance ;-)
25/11/2021,Brian Walker,Yeah - please re-instate the ability to edit link blocks in the editor. It's kind of embarrassing telling a client they can't edit their own links... the whole point of providing them with the editor is so they can manage their own site - bit pointless if they have to contact me to do it.
23/11/2021,Friends Of Ours,Imagine trying to sell Webflow over Wordpress to a client and having to say you can't edit links... becoming growingly concerned about the future of Webflow.
