30/04/2022,Team Troponin,Agreed this is super necessary. Seems like such a basic feature at least from a nav perspective...how many websites need nested menus? Tons.
03/02/2022,RSquared,Been a year since the last update on this. Any news?
04/02/2021,Jacob Kenning,This is huge for me too. I have made a complex navigation for a government website. I can't symbolize the navigation. So if I need to change an item I have to copy and paste it to every page.Here's my site: https://bonneville-county.webflow.io
19/11/2020,Josse Marchoul,I need this so hard. You can't make a dropdown menu for an ecommerce website without nested collections as symbols. How am I supposed to make a big navigation?
