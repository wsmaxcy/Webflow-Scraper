05/02/2019,Jonatan Saine,I cannot stress enough the need for importing design files and convert them into a working environment automatically. I know it sounds extremely complicated and challenging but in a way isn't that where technology is headed? Whether Webflow or another startup that a 10-year old develops this will be an incredible feature. Thank you Webflow for your amazing product! Cheers.

24/10/2017,Jason Jason,the ability to import Sketch docs is table stakes for any type of software like Webflow i.e. Invision Reach Studio Kite etc. Every other tool I'm evaluating has this feature and will be a key factor in deciding which tools I use.
07/10/2017,Fernando Bazzon,Total!
22/07/2017,Tom Binroth,AGREE. yes this would speed up routine building times dramatically

13/05/2017,Luca,As far as I am aware of there's at least two ongoing projects right now that are moving in this direction. Reducing the gap between design and development is probably the biggest challenge right now. I think it's a key feature that somehow should be available. Not sure if it should be via Sketch but certainly in the near future the most successful website builders will be those that allow integration with prototyping features.
02/05/2017,Daniel Rivera,This would be a great feature to add!
01/04/2017,Tee Jay,me too
