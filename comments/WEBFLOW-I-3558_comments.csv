02/09/2022,Victoria Blacksher,Combo classes are a very powerful tool but when you can't see their names in the navigator it leads to a ton of clicking & digging to find the right layer. It would be incredibly helpful to be able to at least see the last style name in the nav instead of the first (more generic) name as listed above. Pretty please. Add this feature/option and save your users so much wasted time.

28/03/2022,Leon Vermij,Totally agree on this one. everything is section in the nav on my end. almost doubting to go to section-about type of naming but man that would destroy te purpose of global classes
02/09/2021,Jayse Hansen,This is one of THE biggest problems with the navigator: we can't use it to navigate.It would be such a simple improvement that would easily speed up every minute of everyday of our workflow. Even if there was a preference to add the first combo class at least. Looking at a long list of repeated 'section's and 'containers' with no other indicators of what each contains is pretty frustrating.
