18/08/2022,Gus Ferguson,+1(00000) for this - without this webflow is basically a fancy landing page builder
04/04/2022,Emiel van Lieshout,this should really be implemented
31/01/2022,Niels Buenemann,Same. +1
21/01/2022,Molly Rudoni,PLEASE webflow make this a feature! It's seriously causing me headaches with tracking users' interest in certain themes across our site. This simple feature would be so so valuable for marketing.
21/05/2021,Brady Bell,It's crazy how this is not a feature yet!
07/06/2020,Josh,did this feature ever get implemented?
24/12/2019,Yasmina Lembachar,Same! I have all news case studies and publications for my organisation in one main collection ('insights') at the moment as I also need to be able to show all of them in one collection list. But it would be great to be able to differentiate between each in the slug by type e.g. 'case-study/...' or 'report/...' etc.
