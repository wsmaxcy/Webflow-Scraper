22/07/2022,Andrea Ilgner,Why is this not a thing yet? ðŸ¤”
07/04/2022,Rob C,And a way to track orders from mobile device would be nice
02/03/2022,Tyler Cagle,This is awesome! I've built an app to just do that â€“ adding removing and editing dynamic content like blog posts job listings product offerings etc.
22/01/2022,Gareth Cooper,This is essential! One of the best selling points for our clients is the ease of use of the editor compared to other platforms but this is greatly diminished when you can't use it on mobile or tablet. Sort it out please Webflow!
29/11/2021,Andres Gonzalez,user-generated content. YES.
17/11/2021,Benjamin Fille,I created Phoneflow for that. It's available on Android and iOS devices (iphone and ipad).
16/10/2021,Sebastian Brink,Squarespace has an excellent app that allows customers to add pages edit content and products accÃ¨s analytics and more.
22/03/2021,Marty Gray,I've tried working with dynamic content earlier. It used to be interesting and exciting but now it doesn't work. Although you are looking for a mobile solution first of all you should consider integration of salesforce services. In addition it is very easy to determine the salesforce cost for the web version. It is easier to configure everything in the web version and then to track it in the mobile version.
06/02/2021,Augie Rakow,Has anyone tried Phoneflow?
06/02/2021,Augie Rakow,+1. Pretty surprised canâ€™t even access the Editor in mobile browser.  Where do people make blog drafts on mobile while away from desk in G Docs or something then transfer into Webflow?
20/01/2021,Patrick Geider,This would be great!
13/01/2021,Valentin Steber,Please just add everyone with a blog function wants something like that. WordPress has it its such a disadvantage ...
31/10/2020,Parwaiz Haidary,Yes this is an absolute must.
09/10/2020,Diabetes Tech Jobs,Please!Writing blog posts is much better on the ipad (w BT keyboard) than Macbook (distraction free).
28/09/2020,Alessandra Mirto,We need this please!
16/09/2020,Gianfranco Suito,please please please!
06/08/2020,Baptiste Morin,Yes one App or access Editor with smartphone.
14/07/2020,Jonas PÃ¶lloth,Must need
