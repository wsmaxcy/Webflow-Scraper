12/04/2023,Kieran,Just painful. Spending too much time on the frankly pathetic 'Logic' (which should be renamed to 'Form Only Logic') and not addressing restricting platform capabilities like this. Wasn't the big infrastructure update last year meant to allow for things like this to be solved or at least increased?
15/03/2023,Ryan Crosbie,ESSENTIAL
07/03/2023,Red de Leon,Yeah I would love to see an increase in the nesting ability in general. I've taken over maintenance of a site where we have to join multiple collections just like any old relational database and we hit the limit right away.
02/03/2023,Neil Fellows,Oh PLEASE update this!! I'm trying to build a site for a client with CMS houses plotted onto a map all great but they can only have x5 houses - I need 30! So frustrating :(
08/11/2022,CFECFW,This is an urgent request. It's almost not worth using Webflow without at least 10 items. Considering moving to a different platform.
11/10/2022,Dane Crozier,Unfortunately I am one of the many who have run into this limitation after spending weeks on design only to have to now consider drastically changing the product and workflow for myself and my client. Please increase this limit. It would be massively helpful.
22/09/2022,Lennart Hennig,F**K me this is so frustrating and unnecessary. And the most frustrating part is that easily fixable wishes like these are ignored by the team. Please Webflow fix this or at least respond!
14/09/2022,Developer Account,Webflow please increase the limit. Please! This is very important feature and very useful. Please increase the limit. Other solutions are available but there are many steps to perform to achieve the results that I don't want to do.
01/09/2022,Robin René Lindberg,Im crying every day because of this limit. Still crying...
15/07/2022,Chris St. Jacques,Any updates here? This is honestly one of the worst limitations from a product I have ever experienced. 5?! Really?
07/07/2022,Josué David de la Vega Torres,Absolutely ridiculous to have that limitation.
17/05/2022,Alan Alston,At least make it an even number! I mostly pull images to display in a grid as I'm sure you know the 12 column grid and well 12 is not dividable by 5. Not even close.
03/05/2022,DART 301,oh my god please yes what is this 5 item limitation? tomato tomato dont want it give us more
27/04/2022,Glenn Eastland,Can we please sort this asap @Webflow
05/04/2022,Scoutely SRM,Webflow those of us who think about nested collections also understand the risks regarding speed if we do crazy things with it. For the straight forward implementations it's a none issue... do you have any timeline in the limit increase? Or when it will be considered?
21/02/2022,Guest,Thank you for sharing your valuable solution it's work properly. www.myloweslife.com
03/02/2022,Creative Bastards,Absolute must have! A Webfow staff member advised met to use this workaround in the meanwhile https://www.finsweet.com/attributes/cms-nest. It's not ideal but until they release this feature you can get your project working!
19/01/2022,Tobias Vollprecht,MUST HAVE
15/12/2021,Dave Cruickshank,This HAS to be an artificial limit (i.e. a limit intentionally imposed in the system).  Why would the limit exist otherwise?  Is it a for performance reasons?  Either way the 5 item limit is a bit ridiculous.  I certainly can understand needing to cap it but 5?  Please increase.
06/12/2021,Ryan Appleseed,I did so much work to get to the point where my site was functional. Then I discovered this glaring ridiculous issue. Please fix this.
