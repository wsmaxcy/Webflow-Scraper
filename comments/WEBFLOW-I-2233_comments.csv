16/02/2022,Matt,I always thought it was standard and courteous business practice to give at least a 30 day prior notification to a renewal charge. Once again the onus comes back on Webflow customers to create their own workaround to Weblow's short falling by setting up their own renewal reminder.
11/09/2020,Gayathri Gopalakrishnan,Had the same experience. I would argue that this is not an interesting add on feature but a basic necessity to ensure that users dont feel like they are being tricked into renewal.
