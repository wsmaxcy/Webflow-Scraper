13/12/2022,Michael Wells,I have a decent attributes-based solution here in this cloneable;
22/07/2022,Victor Zohni,Please add this feature ASAP!
19/07/2022,Ruairi McNicholas,If you need captions for multi-image field from a CMS item you can enter some JS code to automatically add the images ALT description as a caption.
29/05/2022,Loren,Building a site for a photographer - REALLY need this feature as captions are very important for my client.
04/05/2022,Seaport Tattoo,So sad not to implement this yet. Seems like a pretty simple add in 3 years. This platform is SUPER expensive and they should throw a little of that rev to development. Hoping F'insweet does it for them soon.
27/04/2022,Pablo Sara,Please take it a bit further: we need a fully customizable (style and layout) CMS lightbox.
15/04/2022,Laura Campbell,i'd like the captions in lightbox to display beneath the images--NOT on top of them! The edges of my photos are important and i hate that the caption becomes part of the image. please offer an option for this!
24/01/2022,Dennis Lan,This would be great to have natively! The current workarounds are  too complicated.
03/12/2021,Julieta Ascar,And we need them in rich text!
24/11/2021,Zoe Kizimchuk,This feature was apparently coming "soon" in 2019. It's 2021 - where is it and many of the other missing CMS features? https://discourse.webflow.com/t/add-captions-to-a-lightbox-video-gallery-with-cms/91204/2
31/08/2021,Effertz Sheila,I’ve tried playing around but unless I’m missing something obvious it doesn’t seem possible. The only alternative is to offer multiple single image uploads within the CMS.
27/07/2021,Paul Seymour,This is like Obvious 101... come on guys use that $140 million Series B where it counts. Not on the flashy stuff but on the everyday things that will retain your users. My clients and I will happily jump ship the second someone beats you on these basics with ultimate customizability. $2.1 billion valuation... yet no ability to do captions for sets of images? Hmm...
26/07/2021,Pablo Sara,Please!!!!!
14/05/2021,Sarah Loh,Is there any update on the timeline for this feature? Really slows things down to have to implement a workaround :(
19/01/2021,Shawn Aller,Isn't this a feature yet?
