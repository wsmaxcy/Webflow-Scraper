29/01/2022,Margaret,This would be extremely helpful! Started a new site on Webflow after working with several sites on Squarespace and was super surprised that some kind of analytics dashboard wasn't already in place.
21/02/2021,Joe Russell,This could be even simpler and retain more privacy for visiting users than Google Analytics.
07/11/2020,Jonathan Smith,Any update?
25/09/2020,Alexandre S.,Yes please ! Analytics with true numbers. See this post in the forum.
20/02/2019,Alex Dixon,+1Â This would be super handy and I imagineÂ it wouldn't be too much work to surface this on the editor screen (quick win) ðŸ¤—
14/02/2019,Tellgrid,The likes of Squarespace and Shopify do this really well. Would love to have it available on Webflow.
20/04/2018,Gavin Kosko,I would love this! Please implement!
12/04/2018,Nicolas duclos,I would like statistic like Jetpack plugin for Wordpress.
