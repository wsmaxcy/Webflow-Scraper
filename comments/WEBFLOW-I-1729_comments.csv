05/05/2023,Mateja Miladinovic,I am amazed that this isn't possible to do. I am in the middle of a build of my first ecommerce and now I'm stuck. The whole idea is to have custom fields as you do on CMS collections. What's the point of talking about csv import for product if you can't do it for custom fields. And this is a dead end since 5 years ago? Wow.

08/03/2022,Cody Arsenault,plz add this. plzzzzzzzzzzzzz1!!!!!!!!!!!
07/01/2022,Timber Hills,It's good to share good thoughts and ideas around. So here I m sharing what i found interesting: https://farmihomie.com/rent-an-apartment-in-new-york-with-ny-habitat/
05/01/2022,Dean Newsome,Caught out by the lack of basic functionality on Webflow (and not for the first time). I'm 1 month into an e-comm website re-design with hundreds of products and foolishly expected request 1 to 'just be there'. That's because it should be! Come on guys in almost every respect Webflow is hands down the best solution out there and everything is just peachy then WHAM! there it is again the missing (but absolutely crucial) 1% needed to complete the design.
21/11/2021,Jamie Stewart,Couldnt agree more with John. I love the latest design updates but come on if Webflow doesn't want to lose market share to alternative eCommerce builders like Shopify or WooCommerce this is a must!
18/06/2021,Tiphaine Bruel,No updates...?
27/09/2020,Travis Dorsey,This needs to be added yesterday
22/09/2020,Diego Garza,Still not plans to release this feature? :(
29/07/2020,David Waters,agreed this a a critical piece of functionality.
04/03/2019,Paul Conte,I don't know how this doesn't have more upvotes but this is crucial. For store owners who have hundreds of products with custom fields it is almost virtually impossible to use Webflow without this feature.
22/01/2019,John Atkinson,Essential functionality in my view. We must be able to efficiently manage data in and out using import / export routines in order to build stores quickly.
