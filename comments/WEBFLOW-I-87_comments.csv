05/05/2023,Colin Martin,6 years later and still not available !
26/04/2023,Jürgen Strahm,Replacement would avoid x versions of duplicates in the media section + meta description etc. should be not touched
23/03/2023,Joe Eitzen,Where is this at? This is desperately needed for large websites.
21/10/2022,Ryan Hale,It's boggling that they didn't set this up in the first place. How is this a sustainable workflow? And why haven't they instituted this update since this original feature request was submitted back in… 2017???
06/09/2022,Carlos Tocchetto,It is September 2022 and webflow didn't manage to add this very basic feature. Five years later and we are still waiting!
18/05/2022,Ethan Baldwin,Jumping on this thread. Right now I'm making a work around by turning a re-used constantly updating data image into a symbol but being able to simple update the image asset itself would be incredibly helpful.
12/04/2022,Rachel Klausner,Really need this feature!! I need to compress all images for better loading and now have to re-assign hundreds of images throughout. Thanks!
31/03/2022,Ernst Rosén,Will we ever see this happen?
28/03/2022,Elly Schietse,Yes please - I would have hoped this to be basic functionality
16/02/2022,Mariya Lambrianov,Its a must! Still no replace :(
06/10/2021,Matt Hodkinson,Has the definitely been 'shipped'?
13/08/2021,Alain,Does this work now?
28/06/2021,Christoffer Furnes,This has now been labeled as 'Shipped' but I'm not able to figure out how I actually does this!
22/10/2020,Marcel Deelen,Is this indeed shipped?
06/12/2017,John Biethan,Good generic time of the day!
27/09/2017,Matti,Yes please and don't forget to include files like pdf and so on. I still have to to host pdf's myself even though webflow now supports pdf's. The fact that I cannot update ex. product pdf catalog linked at numerous places makes it a no way to go.
19/09/2017,Stuart McMorris,Any update on this?
04/07/2017,Ron Besseling,This is a basic functionality which most people use. I would love to see this implemented.
15/03/2017,Tom Pan,Replacing images in asset manager would be a HUUUGE timesaver! Please please please! :)
23/01/2017,Gabriel Brodersen,Oh god yes!!
