17/01/2023,Quiz Live,Webflow is very backward missing this basic feature. With WordPress you can use a Gravity Form to control the subject field by inserting any variable you like including client and company names and enquiry ID numbers etc. Very disappointing as it means that incoming email notifications get threaded even through its from different people. You would think they would have improved this by now.
