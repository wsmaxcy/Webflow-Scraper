08/05/2023,Mikko Hirvonen,I don't know companies won't do this by default. The amount of time what all clients are using for manual downloading and uploading/forwarding to bookkeeping softwares is huge. If everyone are using 5min per month for such a needless procedure you can easily calculate how many work hours this is taking per year. Personally I could even pay for some money for having this feature.
21/04/2023,Vít Soural,This would be great!
26/02/2023,Jan Lenaerts,Upvoting this easiest solution is attaching the invoice as PDF for automation in the book keeping process.
31/01/2023,Niels van Houdt,Let me be the first of this year :D. Please fix. Thank you in advance.
24/11/2022,Irina Goronja,I totally agree with the rest this is imho long overdue. Thx in advance for implementing it!

19/07/2022,Dan Debnam,In a world of automation this would really help our accounting/bookkeeping process to have invoices attached as PDF.
04/05/2022,PDC Creative,Would be a great option to have. Especially as I have to download them add them to an email and forward on to accounts. Gets to be a PITA especially when you have 70+ clients and around 10 of those are paying monthly. Or having the option to add an accounts email would be great but if they still have to download their end they will kick off anybody in an active session. Which is the first issue we had.
04/02/2022,Conversal,+1If you attach the PDF to an email bookkeeping software can handle it automaticallyAnd a single invoice per month we're you see you're complete usage of that month would be great as well when you have clients where you sell Webflow to.
11/01/2022,Fred Drouar,I would also require this as the email has to be manually downloaded and then forwarded to the accounting software. We live in 2022 and we expect some support in automation from our suppliers.
06/01/2022,Maybaum Film,As a designer I have to manually download and send the invoices to our finance department. I would like to add the email of our finance department into the billing setting.
12/07/2021,Pieter Oosthuizen,Agreed. Having the email go to the billing department but then not have the invoice attached means that it is yet another thing that has to get done each month – which in a small company can really add up to a long list. Would be great to get this resolved.
18/06/2021,Nikolai Narvestad,I don't understand the last comment Jon Roar. I cannot see this feature in our account. We are on the light plan perhaps we need pro?
12/05/2021,Jon Roar Odden,Supports this. Seems so easy and "everybody" has it now.
23/04/2021,Gallery 44,Yes! If they did this it would be so easy to automate billing for us.
18/01/2021,Bastian Gierull,This would be so useful!! There is no point in having a billing team address but not giving them a chance to download pdf bills. Creating a login for accounting is a) costly and b) risky (as there is no clear roles and rights mgmt). So now billing consumes a lot of time back and forth and confusion - could be a deciding factor in moving to another solution tbh.
21/12/2020,Ben Donnelly,I would also like this as the email goes to our billing department but they do not have access to webflow. So they just ask me to download the pdf each month. Attaching the pdf to the email would make this a whole lot simpler!
