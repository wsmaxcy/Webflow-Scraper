15/01/2021,Martin Ollivere,Thank you very much for pointing that out Philipp I never even noticed that box!  It would be nicer if it was in the actual timeline where I instinctively want to click to add. Also the ability to drag multiple keyframes around to change the timing of a whole animation would also be really useful
