17/06/2022,Hamish Cooper,I'd say this whole section could benefit hugely from a redesign. You can't zoom the timeline so there's very little room to play. I get why it's a vertical layout but more room here and grouping features would be great.Also it's very tricky to adjust timings of the feel of a website as it scrolls. So allowing you to group and set say the amount of percentage that group takes up would really help. Imagine the groups took up vertical space and could be clicked into to reveal their animations within their allocated space.
