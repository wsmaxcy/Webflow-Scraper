03/06/2023,Josh Windatt,This feature is still not available in the UK and I assume other regions. I didn't expect to find this barrier considering how long e-commerce has been live on Webflow. Is there a workaround other than FoxyCart. I love Webflow for its design ability and adding a platform on top isn't the same.
04/02/2022,Jon Trelfa,For ecommerce and the calculation (at checkout) of shipping charges based on postcode / zipcode I really need Webflow to enable this functionality for the UK. All our websites are hosted on Webflow but we have to use FoxyCart as our provider - they allow shipping charges to be calculated by weight and postcode area. Even with a small country like the UK there are huge variations in shipping charges so one size does not fit all. It really doesn't make sense for me to have the above split. Please implement as soon as possible.
11/04/2021,Andrew Clark,Thanks for post!
10/02/2021,Eivydas Račkauskas,It would really solve my main headache on Webflow and I believe Webflow potentially loses a lot of potential ecommerce subscriptions that turn to Shopify just because of this.
19/01/2021,Erryl Tudor,I am having to stick with shopify until this is implemented. It cannot be that complicated to set up  matrix of postcodes/zipcodes with delivery charges next to each one. It could be downloaded from an Excel spreadsheet or a comma delimited file or even entered manually (god forbid). That would allow free local deliveries small charge within a bigger radius more countrywide and then country based for rest of world. I'm in Australia by the way
08/01/2021,Jesse Shauffer,I am shocked that this has not been added yet considering you are now marketing to enterprise level clients (without memberships BTW). This is required for small businesses who do local deliveries.

28/11/2020,Jason Drury,I would love this and really need this to be a feature very soon. I feel this should be a high priority.
12/02/2020,Slava Fomkeen,That would be amazing to have this. Would switch half of my clients from Squarespace to Webflow. Not sure if there is a current work around?
05/12/2019,Kai Jolly,Really need this in the UK - to charge different shipping/delivery rates for different UK postcode areas. I hope this gets picked up and implemented! :-)
