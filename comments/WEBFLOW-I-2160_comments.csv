28/09/2021,Flow Phantom,Hey ðŸ‘‹ I built Flow Phantom to help you build upsells in Webflow ecommerce! Let me know what you think!
20/05/2021,UXFLOW,I would love to see a Upsell option in Checkout - in the slider and on page. I have it as a standard in all Shopify sites and it works extremly well
04/06/2020,Christopher Elamri,But how would the upsell be triggered post-checkout?
14/12/2019,Cristian Zweigler,Why don't you add a multi-reference field to your products collection? Here you can specify other products for cross and upselling.
