26/01/2023,Graham Barr,Can't beleive this is still not addressed and only has 2 votes??  I have over 200 client sites I have to invoice prior to hosting renewal date and then hope they pay me before the hosting autorenews.  Either give us the option to add client card info or give us an auto-renew toggle switch (like every other Sass).  It's stressful when clients dont pay and you know their hosting will auto-renew on YOUR credit card.
