21/04/2017,Corey Schwartz,I too would like to have this feature.  Our use case is the contractor developing the site uses Webflow.  When they complete their work I want to have a complete copy of the site stored locally.  If ever we need to hire a new contractor I can't loose access to the existing work.  A proprietary format is fine just need to be able to import/export.
