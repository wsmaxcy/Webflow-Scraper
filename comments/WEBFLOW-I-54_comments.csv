07/01/2020,Doyle Cook,I would like the ability to manually re-order the symbols - valentines day gifts for herÂ 2020 the same as we can move the interactions up and down to create our own order.
28/09/2017,Paul Middleditch,SASS (SCSS) export would be great. Convertors are ok but there's a lot of tidying up to do. It would be nice if a series of files could be exported that can then be compiled. This makes coding a lot tidier and quicker for those bigger development projects especially if you are exporting for Wordpress and other CMS's.
12/03/2017,Justin Byrne,Just use an online converter to convert your sass on export.I would prefer to see the ability to use SASS within the CSS editor.
18/01/2017,Martin,This would be really useful I'v had to convert the exported CSS to SASS a couple of times and it's not fun!
