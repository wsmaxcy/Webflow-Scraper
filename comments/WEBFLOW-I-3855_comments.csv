26/06/2023,Phillip Cabell,We definitely need this moving forward. Is there any update on this being implemented? Conversion API is a must.
03/04/2023,Luis Manuel Rojas,April 2023 and still here without our FB Conversions API Solution!!!
23/03/2023,VA Watch,When are we going to have Facebook Conversion API on our webflow websites?
21/03/2023,Grant Watkins,Any updates on this?
22/02/2023,Kevin,Wie need it!!!
10/02/2023,Benjamin Schneider,whats up on this? Is this possible or not? If we cant have the conversion api on webflow we cannot use webflow..
06/01/2023,Juan C. Guerrero,Why is this still not ready?
10/12/2022,Anas,We must have this by January Facebook said it has become mandatory for all advertisers to have conversion API set up in January!
05/10/2022,Andrew Aidman,I used aws but don't see server data coming to my facebook ads manager yet. If not I may need to set up using zapier integration but I hear it can give you issues due to duplication. Would love to see webflow make this as easy as it is on shopify.
29/06/2022,Yannik Growably,Is there any new info concerning if the conversion api support is coming and when? We have more and more clients who decide against Webflow because of the mission conversion api support...
07/06/2022,Adlante,When it is going to be ready? The facebook pixel is goint to die any day soon and we will be leaving without a solution to do paid media.
31/05/2022,Adam Murray,Working with a company that has over 20 websites which we want to use Webflow for currently a free Wordpress plugin is enabling us to do this without a solution the price of running 20 CAPI gateways is ridiculous please address soon Webflow staff.
30/04/2022,Martin,Are we still waiting for this?
21/04/2022,Guest,Thanks !!
08/04/2022,Levi,This is a crucial function for any agency building websites in WebFlow and using Facebook Ads to promote them. Please release this feature ASAP. The Amazon Gateway is too expensive for lots op people.
10/03/2022,Ani Guillen,How much longer is this going to take? It's a crucial feature and can only be solved by you on your servers side.
08/03/2022,Ois√≠n Halpin,Hey guys
