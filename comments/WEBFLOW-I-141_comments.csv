08/05/2018,Isaac N.C.,I need this for a website I'm building. I would need CMS capabilities so that each CMS item could create a new pin on the map. Ideally the pins could be clickable to show a tooltip too but I'm probably getting carried for this ticket...
06/04/2018,Franco Ruarte,Absolutely. I would like to do a multiple pin location map like these one at bottom on this landing page: delviento.com.ar
05/12/2017,Guido Jansen,I have a CMS collection of conferences each in a different location. I would like to show a Gmap on top of the page with a pin for each event.
24/08/2017,Niall,Hi Ken can you clarify this please?I have a similar need.I have a map on a site. I'd like to add multiple spots to the map indicating locations of vehicles.
