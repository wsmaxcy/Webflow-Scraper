03/03/2022,Sean,This is a glaring oversight and lack in very fundamental features for any sort of a blog or CMS in such an otherwise mature and well-thought-out product as Webflow. Of course any blog author expects to make an uploaded photo or graphic expandable to full-size on clicking as that has become expected behavior on the Web. Please fill the gap.PS: Workaround - Note that you CAN manually laboriously add a link to each image in the rich text editor that leads to the same image in its own browser tab (by clicking on the image in the RTE clicking the wrench icon clicking "Link" then pasting in the URL field the URL of the image (or larger version of the image that you've also hosted on webflow or elsewhere). That's not very elegant though and simply plops an image in an otherwise-empty browser tab with no styling and missing the expected close/minimize controls.
