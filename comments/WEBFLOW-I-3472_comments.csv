24/04/2023,Tor Vegard Tobiassen,Any updates? Still need this to make ecommerce pages in a lot of countries.
10/04/2023,Jasper Middendorp,Adding to the comments here seems pretty crazy such a basic feature is not avaiable. Especially as it basically mean you cannot use the ecommerce functionality in Europe without an external plugin.
28/03/2023,Ada Matic,Really frustrating having made an entire page in Webflow and now realizing the webshop won't be legal in Norway since the tax calculation does not work. What's the status here?
29/01/2022,Robert Magnussen,No news? It's almost hard to believe that this feature is still lacking. Should be quite simple and would help a lot of us.
07/12/2021,DL Privat,I am deeply disappointed by Webflow that this central function is not given makes it almost impossible to run the online shop without third-party programs in Europe as TaxJar also provides wrong values.  This problem does not seem to exist only since yesterday see also comments from last year. I would much rather have a manual input of taxes than a poorly functioning automatic one. This is about complying with the legislator's regulations so to only refer to the third party without the possibility of manual changes is a bit questionable in my opinion.
01/12/2021,Lars Sass,I am absolutely disappointed by webflow Ecommerce. I am an extrem Webflow enthusiast and love the way webflo perfoms and do there marketing. But after month of work on my ecommerce shop there is no way to edit the tax in the checkout process. There is still an issue by generating the right tax for Germnay and many other countries in the EU.I really hope that webflow is fixing this issue otherwise Ecommerce is absolutely useless for Germany...
09/09/2021,Lexi Woodward,Not having this feature is very problematic for my store.
30/08/2021,JÃ¶rg Agostini,Definitely a big draw back. The formula for the tax calculation already exists it would be a matter of adding the percentage(s) done and dusted.
29/08/2021,Hossein Lavi,This is really mind blowing that you can't manually set the taxes. SO many hours of work to waste! Please this should be part of the basics a need to have function.
21/04/2021,Matthew Greene,Webflow it blows my mind the basic features you skip over. This should be a simple add.
26/01/2021,Robert Magnussen,This should indeed be a VARY basic feature. As of now Webflow is offering an incomplete product. I mad a site for a Norwegian business but had to say to them after a month that it wasn't possible to fix.A lot of lost money only because of Webflow...
15/12/2020,Grant Senior,Similar problem for wanting to use Webflow as the Ecommerce platform for any sites here in New Zealand. I currently have 3 sites that will not be getting built in Webflow due to this. Please Webflow please look into this sooner rather than later. We will both benefit.
25/11/2020,Rocky Gord,Thank you so much for the proposal.
10/11/2020,Eric Unger,I desperately need this! Ecommerce stores in a couple Canadian provinces are totally limited on what they can sell (ie. clothing) because the tax rate is wrong. We need manual tax calculation!
10/11/2020,Astecil LDA,is there any way around it?
08/11/2020,Robert Magnussen,I cant believe it's not possible.
04/11/2020,Tobias Urban,It should be a basic feature for Ecommerce Websites.
