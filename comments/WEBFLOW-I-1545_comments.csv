20/12/2021,Rick Erickson,This definitely has my vote.  Not having it seriously interferes with workflow
25/02/2020,Mehrnoush Soroush,This features is essential for working with grids. In most cases you're still designing and figuring out things. But then you'd have to know everything before starting because there is no easy way to add or delete rows and comments.
03/06/2019,Roy Castrillo,Grids lose a lot of power without this feature – I'm sure many of use are looking forward to having it available. It doesn't need to be implemented directly on canvas... the Elements Setting panel would also do.
03/04/2019,Diego Rodriguez,This feature is necessary for the cells
22/02/2019,Alex Dixon,+1 👈🏼
17/01/2019,Michael Wells,Even if this is only supported under the gear icon properties ( right side ) rather than on the canvas itself it would be a big help.
06/01/2019,Hywel Thomas,This is the main reason I rarely use grid ATM. Any more than 4 rows and the dragging and dropping is a nightmare. I now use grid for desktop and revert to divs for mobile...
