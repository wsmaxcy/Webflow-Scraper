09/11/2021,Clark AG,100% WE NEED THIS — One of the amazing features that drew me to Webflow was the super simple Client Editor mode. This was a well thought out feature considering what a headache it is teaching Wordpress clients how to use their own website.
05/01/2021,Dave Cruickshank,I COMPLETELY agree with this and feel that this is the one feature missing from Webflow that would make it perfect for me.In the CMS I use more often (Statamic) there is a functionality called GLIDE that allows you to set the resize crop and focal point (as well as add other effects like watermarks).The ability to resize to any aspect ratio (not rescale) an image (while respecting a specified focal point) to fit a specific useage on your website (while retaining access to the original-size image) would be a god-send to Webflow.Object-fit is a workaround but not a full-on solution.

28/06/2018,PS Werbung,Thats a good point… webflow should handle the large files downsize them to a (admin set) default max. size of course also with the thumbnail(s).
