08/05/2017,Improve Webflow,What? Why would you even want support for IE9? And no that's not even possible. Not without an immense amount of programming and hard work only for it to be wasted when something is finally used by 2 people on the planet. Internet Explorer is no longer supported and it's dead. No one should be using it except cheap companies that deserve to die because they built their applications to only support IE. No wonder Webflow has "Under consideration" as a default for all new Wishlist posts. And no wonder they don't even look at half of them.
