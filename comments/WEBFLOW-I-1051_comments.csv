09/08/2019,Blanca Szabo,Same issue. A zoom feature would be much appreciated. Some small tweaks e.g. when setting the padding the number could be blown up a bit (then go back to small) and a general zoom setting for the screen. I'm working on a 4K monitor and I feel like Webflow's current interface is only optimised for 15 inch laptops (Webflow is just about able to function on a 13 inch but that's ok I manage). For those of us who're are on iMacs and other larger screens it'd be nice to have a zoom-in function.
