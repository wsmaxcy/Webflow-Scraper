23/07/2022,Luca,This would make Webflow interactions a lot more powerful. I wouldn't limit it to form but rather have some conditional logic that can be applied everywhere as expressed in this feature request: https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1945?return_to_action=vote_6673532581446151378.
11/05/2022,Harvey Carpenter,+1In the meantime Growform does this perfectly for Webflow (I know because I built it!)
19/01/2022,Andrew Maccabe,Jumping onboard with this in 2022 (this still hasn't been addressed yet!!)Currently relying on Jotform for this I have a client that has some big forms with lots of conditional fields (and also calculations!!) that would simply take ages to create in webflow with interactions or require custom code.
15/07/2021,Andre Xavier,I need this feature ASAP!!
29/03/2020,Derek Clark,This feature is a must have for many of my client's sites.
30/10/2019,Glenn Eastland,+1 standard feature!
02/10/2019,Vlad Ivanco,Please it's so crucial
26/07/2019,Nathan Last,This can be done using radio buttons and interactions
19/12/2018,Abel Garcia,I can't wait for this one please webflow we need this one. Thank you!!
31/10/2018,Filip Moerman,That would be great.
27/04/2018,Neil Fellows,Plus 1 for this. I'm new to Webflow and building a site that uses a Jotform with LOTS of conditional logic would be a HUGE timesaver if this was a feature.
10/01/2018,Noah Raskin,Dude this would be sooooo awesome man! Need this!
09/11/2017,Noah Raskin,Would absolutely love this feature!
