20/07/2022,Zebra Creative,I'm an agency owner and this and the 100 page limit are really swaying me away from Webflow. It's been a big part of our workflow but this has affected too many of our clients. It's a silly limitation that really makes webflow not work for more than just pretty marketing sites. A real bummer.
15/11/2021,Nathan,60 field limit is a huge pain the in arse. 160-200 would be much more reasonable. Is there any chance that Webflow will increase this number in the near future?
26/04/2021,Aidan Brotherhood,I agree with this. While it might nto be a problem for everybody having a capped number of collections isnâ€™t ideal.
