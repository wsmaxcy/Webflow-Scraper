05/05/2023,René de Haas,Any updates? Would be nice to copy class to tag as well
11/04/2023,Jamaka,I'm 5ive years late but still seems this is an issue or i'm missing something?
13/09/2021,ImmediPay,I would love to be able to copy full section attributes and assign to sections on other  pages especially if you make the TERRIBLE mistake of not using the 'starred' Desktop breakpoint that controls all the other styles by default.
25/03/2020,Joanne Santos,Class additions and subtracts is something i heavenly used in my react projects 8 ball pool it would be on the of best things to hit webflow.
19/12/2019,Ryan Chatterton,This would save me from annoyingly clicking on an element and typing the name between a bunch of elements.
01/10/2019,Vesper Sinclair,A must-have feature!
16/09/2019,Production Within,Bringing this back! I'd love to be able to copy an effect like box shadow from one element to another. This would save me soo much time especially with clients who like to change things across the entire website.
13/05/2019,Philippe Côté,Agreed! This would help a whole lot! Sometimes we have similar classes but they belong to totally different contexts. Copy/pasting between those classes would be helpful.Another example (that happened to me a few times) is to style one class only to discover later this styling should belong to another class instead. There is no other way than to start over manually. Copy/Pasting would solve this problem.Rule #4 here (User control and freedom or Permit easy reversal of actions):
26/04/2019,Troy Robinson,This is a game changer for workflow efficiency.
03/10/2018,Tyler Beaty,please please please do this for gradients!
03/08/2018,Justin Maxwell,Figma user as well. 99% of the issues posted here are low hanging fruit and then they archive them. It's really frustrating.
10/07/2018,Marcus Shields,Just came to Webflow from Figma. This is low hanging fruit here.
24/04/2018,Jan Letocha,This is such a simple thing but it would be so useful. Together with the ability to select multiple objects at the same time.
23/06/2017,Ibok Ibokulus,Come on! This needs to happen!
