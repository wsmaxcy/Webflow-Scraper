18/05/2022,Ross McCully,I'm having to duplicate a blog area into 5 smaller blog areas and it feels like some kind of duplicate functionality here would be really useful. I was able to export a csv and re-import it then hook up my fields again but this did feel a little clunky and prone to user error. Like others are saying a "duplicate" button within the collection settings would be really useful especially if you have a lot of fields to work with.
31/03/2022,Nick Eagles,please?
03/03/2022,Carlos Tocchetto,such an easy fix why is not done yet?
28/02/2022,Leighton James,I want to share a blog across multiple region folders i have within a main site. So I need to be able to have the collection page (ie. blog article page) sit within a /us/blog-posts/post and a /au/blog-posts/post folder structure. Currently can only sit a level above which messes up the UX ie. /blog-posts/post.
15/02/2022,Brent Lagerman,need this guys
31/01/2022,Andre,Any news on that? @webflow?
09/11/2021,Christer Persson,So... We need this since we now have to duplicate our whole blog collection multiple times because of Webflow's extremely poor support for translations meaning the only viable solution we have for now is to create one collection for each language (And yes we're already using Weglot but adding it to all our blog content would make the bill astronomical unscalable and a total mess to work with)..
07/11/2021,Kim-André Heggenes-Ulleland,Is this realy not avilable? Very strange since without this it requires alot of time creating the same thing over and over again. Please fix this.
10/09/2021,Dion Lovrecich,Dear Webflow see Paul Seymour's comment.
17/08/2021,Stephen,Definitely need this!
29/07/2021,Paul Seymour,2 years ago and you're asking for more informaton on what is perhaps the simplest request I've seen? Again UX 101. Same reason you have duplicate pages. Do you people even look at your own forums? On the top bar of a collection... "Duplicate this Collection" Seriously some of the most basic UX needs are forgotten. Please!
13/07/2021,Bart Kuntz,Yes! We really really need this. I'm constantly repeating the same design steps for making a new collection wrapper with a differeny purpose. Love to see this get implemented.
06/05/2021,Peter Gowrie-Smith,Hey Webflow I too need to painfully duplicate my collections God know how many time. It would be great to get this feature asap.
06/04/2021,Aaron Magnus,I would be willing to pay extra for this feature. Is there any update?
25/03/2021,Mario García de León,This week I have to duplicate about 4 collection pages for 3 different domains (separate markets - same company). And each collection has between 25 and 45 fields + all the editor descriptions + number of characters range. Webflow you should do something about it quickly!!!!!!!!!
14/03/2021,Andre Posel,cetttetteetteette fonctionnalité est-elle au planning des mises à jour ?
17/02/2021,Ayla Hourani,Still no update I guess?
16/02/2021,Admit Ansatt,This would remove a lot of headaces from a lot of heads around the webdesign word :)
15/02/2021,Grace Johnson,Yes this is  a must...add our voice.
