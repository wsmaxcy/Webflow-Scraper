21/06/2023,Daniel Beaudoin,Is anything being done on this by Webflow?
07/06/2023,Sheona Urquhart Smångs,nuts that this isn't integrated yet?!
18/05/2023,Jim A,It's 2023 and there is no Klarna Integration yet. This is why Shopify will be a better platform for us Scandinavians
12/10/2022,Kolja Missura,any updates on this? as far as I understand it the fix would be pretty easy. Stripe already supports klarna
10/08/2022,Ezekiel Rochat,This would be so wonderful! Afterpay or Affirm.
24/07/2022,Khurram Naseer,really need klarna any update on this?
06/07/2022,Nathan Clinnick,We really need this integration! I have been looking at a few of the work arounds but I really don't want to use anything I have found so far. They are basically just links to another site like Shopify. I don't really want to do that as it breaks the consistency throughout my website. If I am going to do that what is the point of Webflow? I may as well transfer the entire site over.
09/06/2022,Anton Felix Kramer,I agree to the comments below. We love Webflow but everytime a client wants an online shop I recommend Shopify ONLY because they have more payment options. Please hurry in implementing Klarna - it's much needed for your customers from Germany and Europe who want to use webflow ecommerce.
16/05/2022,David Simpson,We have been granted access to the Afterpay platform (and they want to do business with us) however it needs to be intergrtated at the Checkout level (similar to what we're doing with PayPal) on our site.
11/05/2022,Claire Xue,please add klarna !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
01/04/2022,Rasmus Bell,highly needed ... since more than two years ... in europe it's essential
11/12/2021,Aykut Gürkan,This payment method is currently extremely popular in Germany. My customer asks about this integration at every meeting. Hope it is on top of your list
14/11/2021,D-Toro,Whats up Webflow - IS THERE NO HELPDESK HERE?? Just read this here - in Europe KLARNA is that thing. Stripe connected now with Klarna - but where is Webflow?
13/11/2021,Yoga Muliawan,Hopefully Webflow consider this payment option!
22/10/2021,Fusion L,Many of these e-commerce integrations seem to have minimal work involved. It is confusing why webflow does not add these.
11/08/2021,Alex,I'm really keen to hear any kind of update from Webflow on this!! Clients are asking me about this pretty much weekly and I can't keep fobbing them off with hopefully coming soon.  That only works for so long.  Dear Webflow - if you can offer some kind of information on this i'd be pleased to hear it.
11/08/2021,Jade Kilshaw,Does any one have an update on this in particular Web Flow? I think i may have to change platforms as Aus customers are 25% of our captured market.
01/08/2021,BrandSpace Studio,Shopify and Squarespace offer Afterpay and Zip through Stripe Integration. Come on Webflow - catch up!

15/07/2021,Liv Strawbridge,I'm In NZ and have clients continually asking about Afterpay integration as they keep getting sent emails about Stripe + Afterpay from Stripe. This is the latest video my client forwarded to me. I wonder if the team at Webflow could integrate the few lines of code as detailed in this video very easily and quickly so we can say yes to our clients?
