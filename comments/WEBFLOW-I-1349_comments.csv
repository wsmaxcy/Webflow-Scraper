23/12/2022,Cyber Sader,I agree. This is very important for flexibility. Some developers want to use custom code to show the user evidence of their submission in other ways without automatically getting rid of the input fields.
07/05/2021,Ernestas Simkus,The Disable of success/failure is a MUST. I think it's the most useless idea to lock and force web designers to use a function they don't need. Why is it forced to use this function? I choose if I want to use this function or not. And Iw seen that someone in other forum said "Well without this people will be just clicking the form and will not know if its submitted" But thats designers fault and he will choose what he want to do with his knowledge. Now I'm wasting my time trying to find a workaround because third party JavaScript uses type="submit" same as webflow. And they have their own messages with a value but I can't find a way to be able to show the value as webflow just makes the form to disappear. The Value from third party email collection also shows a custom discount code to use on my shop page on amazon. But the webflow makes the whole form with all elements disappear. Who's ever idea was to lock the success/error messages and make the form disappear after submission needs to find a new job. The designer needs to be able to choose what he wants to do with all the elements of web developing. Not the platform creator.
