08/02/2019,Pierre-Jean Duval,We were aiming at using Webflow for a huge ecom website (4000+ products) but we'll have to go with Wordpress + woocommerce instead. We love Webflow though. Please do something our SEO partner is crying.

07/02/2019,Hamish Maclean,I created this a while back looking for broader search and custom column visibility and filtering. Without it the best way to manage this sort of thing will be with cloud databases like airtable connected via api. I don't want to do that. I like webflow CMS !!
21/01/2019,Pierre-Jean Duval,Much needed for huge blogs and Ecommerce websites.
