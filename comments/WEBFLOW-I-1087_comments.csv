05/10/2020,Whitaker,This is the closest thing I found to do this...FinSweet Combing JS Function
22/06/2020,Noah Scott,@webflow any updates? Seems like a popular use-case to display a mix of collection items together as one. Or any suggestions for workarounds? I'm a bit worried as I assumed this was possible and sold an internal project to deliver a new blog based on this...
22/03/2020,Edward Goin,ah wish I could edit the above comment...  a few times I referenced "three of this" or "three of that"...  three was just an example... you can have as many post types as you want as long as their combined fields (some fields being shared across multiple post types and some being specific to a particular post type) are in total 30 fields or less (under the CMS plan)  or 60 or less (under the Biz plan)
22/03/2020,Edward Goin,I really want this too as it would make life much easier but there IS a workaround and here are the steps:
07/03/2020,Chat Clussman,Content marketing is a big deal for marketing departments everywhere. Being able to have a resource center with different kinds of content is really important for them. Ideally you can build something like a relational collection that allows you to select common fields from different collections.
02/12/2019,William Valvo,The main issue here is when you have a single collection with the same core content but with multiple types.For example imagine collection Articles with an Image Author and Text.However there are multiple types of Articles. Feature Standard and Snippet.These three types need a different collection page each. A visually dramatic one for Features a plain one for Standard and a smaller one for Snippet. They are are all Articles so you would want to easily pull up a feed (collection list) of all articles in a grid for example.
29/08/2019,Norbert Weiss,Looking forwarding to seeing someone's explanation of the 'business logic' behind this e.g. with filtering more than one table (different) field names of collection items and so on.
11/08/2019,Ryan Deshaies,Gotta make this happen. I have 3 collection lists because I wanted 3 separate layouts for my content but on my home page I have to play a numbers game and make sure that each collection has an even number of items. Then on top of that I have to make sure that each item has an even number of category references in the multi-reference field so that it matches up when the user filters.
08/08/2019,Joshua Fry,Just to add a common use case to this  –  I require it in order to show Blog posts and Events within the same list.
21/05/2019,Syamsul Rozmey,Really need this
23/04/2019,Slow Dance,any updates on this?
20/07/2018,Jon So,Really need this.
23/05/2018,Alex Cheng,Definitely! There should be an option to show ALL collection items in a collection list module. Then we can sort them and filter them.
