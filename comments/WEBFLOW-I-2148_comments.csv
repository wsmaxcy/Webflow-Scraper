09/04/2022,I Chatterjea,I just migrated a client from Wordpress to Webflow one of the draws was forms inside as opposed to using an external site like Jotform for conference proposal submissions. Basic formatting would be very very useful.  Something akin to the functionality for this form that I am using to type this up. I can imagine font colors would be nice but basic bold italics underline  bullet points text alignment and the capacity to embed links would be useful to all of our users.

30/08/2020,Jan,yeah great feature.. I definitely need that too!
06/07/2020,Altavista Studios,Any news on this?
19/06/2020,James Cooper,Any update webflow? I mean I'm literally typing in the box that we are asking access to as we speak  so could you not make it available to us in editor? Thanks!
03/06/2020,Tony Peacock,I too need an RTE form element. The increase in hosting costs to get file upload should include this form element at least.
27/10/2019,Noah Raskin,This NEEEEEDS to happen! Please Webflow make this happen! I have been racking my head for days to figure out some way I can get submissions for CMS content with the rich text field.Â Like Brandyss I use WF Forms + Zapier to update live items and in this area there is no viable solution. I don't know what to do. My new project completely relies on content from various users to create the content themselves and I cannot accomplish this without a ton of manual workarounds and having to get the visitor to send me links from Google Docs and other places.
