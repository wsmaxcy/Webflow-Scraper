21/06/2023,Neekey Ni,This annoys me so much! Especially when you are bootstraping a small side project without a complete class / style system setup beforehand changing styles here and there is the norm and I also sometimes just copy elements or blocks and tweak from them it very easy to forget about that each element has a shared class attached and as a no code platform you will just naturally want to change attributes on the style panel right away without thinking too much the change you are going to make is directly to the class not just on the element you are working on atm.

27/09/2022,Ryan Higgins,+1 we would really benefit from this feature
28/08/2022,Chris Moore,I can't believe this isn't a thing yet!
29/07/2020,Peter Kisters,Really need this for classes being used throughout the site ie. containers or other frequently used ones.
