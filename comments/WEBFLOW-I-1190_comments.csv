11/03/2023,Jeff Selser,Support for this would result in site designs that were actually maintainable. Empower power users please. Can't believe its 2023 and support for variables does not exist.
20/01/2022,Boris B.,This would be a very welcomed features. We are struggling with making our design some of the components of which rely on CSS styling more agile based on CMS content.
23/04/2021,Russell Gathright,Web design has always baffled me from the beginning not because its difficult to understand but as a programer how often web devs don't have the full advantage of working with a computer.  If you can't easily scale a design if you can't easily change 1 value to change many values then things are wrong.I should be able to define things like common margins give 'em a name and slap it on as many elements as I want.  The worst thing ever is when a client decides they like everything but want to see it with box shadows increased from 3 3 to 2 2.    Other elements play off that number so its important to be able to simply make a single change instead of going through everything.
21/01/2021,Jason Syratt,CSS variables on individual cms items would be nice currently im trying to overlap the items a little
16/03/2020,Rocky Berlier,This is precisely what is missing from the designer. Thank you for posting this Vincent. The ability to define a variable to a specific property would be ENORMOUS! I hope this gets the attention it deserves.
21/10/2019,Hamish Maclean,Damn this would be good Vincent
26/06/2018,Aaron Hartshorn,Trying to do this with embed code right now. I can see how this would be awesome especially if it could be integrated with IX2
