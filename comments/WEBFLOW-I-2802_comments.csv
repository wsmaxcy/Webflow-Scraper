03/07/2021,Rannjan Joawn,Yes. It is to hide elements ..but more specifically not all elements at the same time but specific elements when they are selected. For example If I have selected a section or any div ..and I need to hide it quickly ..I should be able to press a keyboard shortcut to go back and forth... and of course the element could be a block/flex/grid/inline etc I should be able to hide it and later come back to the same state when I use the shortcut. I hope I was clear in my explanation.
