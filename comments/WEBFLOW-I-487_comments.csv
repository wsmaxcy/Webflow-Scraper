11/02/2021,AMILIA Anansa,here you will colllect the information about improved Date Filters  and also on this site you will see the details about toolkit uses in Microsoft windows.
21/12/2020,Christopher Wise,How is it still not possible to use actual dates in the date filter?  Show all items from January or 2019  is one of the simplest date filters. Webflow is great but then you run into this duh moment.   Folks.  Please add hard dates to date filtering asap.
20/11/2017,Vincent Bidaux,A list of things that aren’t possible with Webflow CMS with date/time yet:— a date field that has no time— a time field that has no date— use international time (AM/PM didn’t bring you to the moon! )— break down time data in hour minutes seconds etc (mainly for style purposes)— filter on time (like “What’s the earliest screening of all the screenings entered for the whole summer”)— filter on a given month (“all events in August”)— filter on a month range (ie: calendar season sport season etc)— filter on a date range— filter on a time range
