11/05/2021,ADL Studio,Yes I need this too for my clients.
23/11/2020,James Clements,This would help me out so much!
28/10/2019,Steve Holmes,Any movement on this? I have a client with a CMS who is wanting to pull the site (and hosting) to be able to add the jobs via CVS themselves (a service I have been doing for free for them over the last year seeing as they aren't able to) which is a real shame.
31/08/2019,Brian Punger,Agreed Clients shouldnt need to rely 100% on the developer to import data into their own site.
