03/03/2021,Garry Howard,I am appreciating your hard-work. Thanks for sharing this awesome article.
03/12/2020,Jim OConnell,Would like the ability to update individual pages without publishing the whole site. For example if you're redesigning a section and the need arises to fix a small typo on a  different page you have to hold off on the typo until the redesigned section is ready.
06/08/2020,Plan A,just do an option like 'disable new publishing of this page' so the page isn't taken in bulk exports / publishings
06/08/2020,Plan A,This is a must-have !
13/05/2020,Marco Cornacchia,PLEASE.
