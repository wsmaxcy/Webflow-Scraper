17/02/2021,Sasha Boss,Ive built out my site only to find out I cant use a unique lottie animations for each product..
03/02/2021,Justin Gambino,Apologies! Found the solution. Great video easy workaround and works for creating multiple collection template page designs super easy to do. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuP0SFcr6F8
03/02/2021,Justin Gambino,Seriously what the heck we have to use the same layout for every product category? Such a headache...Any idea when multiple layouts for different products will be available?
16/11/2020,Nordenstad Bygg AB,Disapponted that there is no multiple product template. I forced to look for another ecommerce platform.
30/08/2020,Michaya,I am busy setting up my site and can't understand why there is not an option for different product pages and to allow for different categories template. I have multiple categories and collections that need their own specific design and page. For exapmle categories: bracelets necklaces rings etc... and collections that have a particualr inspiration and theme.  When will this be availible??
06/08/2020,Nick Geys,Absolutely necessary.

21/06/2019,Matthew Brown,Arrghh it seems the deeper I go in configuring a Webflow eCommerce site the more I realise they can't offer yet.... need this function!
07/04/2019,John T.,I'm almost done with my site I was adding the product and I just realized this..  :( Really needed.
