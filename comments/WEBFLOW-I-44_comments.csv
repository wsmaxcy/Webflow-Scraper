28/03/2023,Chris,is there any update to this? Currently cant launch site unless I delete the extra pages that im going to end up using in the future when the client is ready
17/05/2022,Pablo Magana,Still looking for this feature... Its very useful and needs to be implemented.
03/12/2021,Leonardo Viada,This is a really important feature in a solution like yours that promotes working with client directly from the design tool. At the moment I can't share a site until it's finished and there arent unwanted pages around.
07/04/2021,Lee Bolden,Are there any updates? This makes the editor side non-functional if they can't hide elements. The suggestion to set display to none is not valid because if it is turned off in the admin site of course it is turned of in the site and the editor. Is there a roadmap for this?
27/02/2020,Charlie Green,Any news if we can hide dynamic pages from the editor yet?
20/01/2020,Ivan Paudice,Especially when using templates I don't want to delete some pages because I might use them later but I don't want to confuse the client
21/05/2019,PS Werbung,Very important for a system which should replace a CMS! Roadmap??

24/04/2018,Matthew P Munger,Form discussion about adjusting visibility of pages to the editor sitemap and robots.
18/01/2017,Markus J.,Don't just hide 'working' pages â€“ allow to hide any pages that editors are not supposed to edit.
