12/08/2022,Maarten Mieras,2022... helloooo
05/07/2022,Red Letter,Agree! This seems like something that should be possible. It is for editor access in WordPress.
20/12/2021,Redthread,Hope this is being worked on! Our clients really want this
26/11/2021,Blanca Nieto,Yes pleasee! I need it!
08/07/2021,Zac McDonnell,This is really annoying
27/05/2021,Kristjan Kesküla,when?
08/04/2021,Charles Sladdin,Desperately needed! Otherwise you end up creating a convoluted CMS workaround or have them uploading to SharePoint or similar first...
07/01/2021,Josh Brown,I just found out about this issue. A client of mine told me that they could not link to an attachment from the Editor. I didn't believe them at first until I tried it myself.
14/12/2020,Jonny Growfox,Ayy update on this??
03/12/2020,Gregor Favre,Strongly needed. Changing PDF documents on a website is a frequent use case for a client.
28/04/2020,Yousef Rayyes,My client needs to update the attached link file on their own frequently! Really slowing things down for them by having to go through me every time! PLEASE FIX!!
21/04/2020,Bruno Bürgi,yesssss pleeeeeeease
17/01/2020,Denise Dambrackas,This is of the HIGHEST priority. We have files for download in a password protected section of the site that need to be changed out regularly by my client.
23/05/2019,Andrew Brewer,This is a MONUMENTAL problem that should really be fixed!
01/03/2019,Jane Stancombe,Urgently need this feature! PLEASE!!!!
23/02/2019,Bryan Garrant,I do not understand how to get around this.  WE NEED THIS FEATURE to allow clients to upload PDFs and other documents into Rich Text fields in Pages.
