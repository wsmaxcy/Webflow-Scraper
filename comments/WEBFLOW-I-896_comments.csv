09/04/2018,Graham Barr,This feature would be great. I'm a (former) Muse user who will be migrating all my Muse projects to Webflow. Having custom thumbnails would be a real advantage. I understand Webflow wants to encourage users to use Webflow hosting but its WAY too expensive for professionals with many sites. Please make Webflow 'professional user' friendly :)
