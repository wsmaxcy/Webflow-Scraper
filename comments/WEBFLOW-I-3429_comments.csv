24/05/2023,Manuel Zechner,They finally addressed this in their recent product update presentation but it's still kinda vague ("…we're gonna make space later this year to address and plan for this…")
01/03/2023,Jorun Kristin,We need this even to be able to concider Webflow as our new platform. And we would really like to because it seems to meet all our needs.
28/02/2023,Nico Ziegler,there is an urgent need for action on the part of Webflow in order not to lose the majority of its EU users!
21/02/2023,Nathan Constantin,please do something about it
12/02/2023,V Ronin,This should be implemented already!
10/02/2023,Dennis Rossiar,We have some customer projects which we would like to implement with Webflow but this is not possible due to the lack of GDPR complience - Will Webflow take steps for this in the foreseeable future?
02/02/2023,Samuel Uebersax,This is so important! Any news?
27/01/2023,Bruno Guerra,We are all waiting in this to make webflow the number one platform in europe
24/01/2023,Valentino,We will still use Webflow on a non legal base in Europe so that a lot of clients still prefer Wordpress just because Webflow is not GDPR compliant. Hard to believe this is being ignored for this long!
20/01/2023,Garrett R,Reviewed? Anything from @webflow on this?
09/01/2023,No-Code Collective,Yes Webflow uses 'reviewed' als 'ignored' in many cases (99% of the time)
06/01/2023,Garrett R,Hard to believe this is being ignored for this long!
14/12/2022,Winno Klg,We need that urgently! It doesn't matter if we have to pay an additional fee. Customers are worried and we want to provide them a clean solution. I hope you can make this an urgent task. Thanks
12/12/2022,Ernst Schollenberger,This problem needs to be addressed urgently...an absolute must for EU users. Without the ability to choose the server location can not use Webflow legally unfortunately.
06/12/2022,Silvan Soeters,Still very much relevant. Please make it happen!
22/11/2022,Drew Moore,Cannot use Webflow for any larger project because of this (too worried about compliance) really needs to be implemented please Webflow.
11/11/2022,Ish Studio,This needs to be implemented Asap!
10/11/2022,Giuseppe Legrottaglie,Algolia example super cool to choose server location
09/11/2022,Lukas Ullrich,Please Please please make it happen!
09/11/2022,Ani Guillen,Was really expecting this to be announced at the Webflow Conf. It doesn't seem like a complicated thing to implement.
