13/11/2018,Skyler Kline,Something else I was just thinking could help this feature would be to have the settings available where the interface puts a transparent black over the interface of the hidden portion of the site but still allows you to test different viewport heights with accurate sizing for anything sized with a VH or VMIN/VMAX units. This could be handy in that it would allow us to see whats below the lower edge of the screen but still understand how our site is reacting to different screen heights.

30/08/2018,Eryc da Silva,Can't vote anymore but this is something I've been hoping for as well.
27/07/2018,Webflow Team,Hi Marcel
27/07/2018,Marcel Deelen,haha that is a bit of a low tech solution Nelson. It would be handy if VH would automatically relate to the previewed viewer width. Little dotted line or something to mark it would be handy too.
27/07/2018,Webflow Team,You can test the viewport height by shrinking the height of your browser window.
