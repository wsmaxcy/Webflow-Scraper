10/06/2023,Smriti Sundar,UX designers are at a loss because of the lack of this feauture
11/01/2023,Sean Young,Also baffled that this isn't a feature yet.
09/11/2022,Rick Erickson,Not a deal breaker but why isn't this a feature?  Video is a web compatible viable common and arguably central UX asset.  Thanks for the Lottie library and generally a platform that is hand's down the best available...just one more step in the assets department and your bases are covered.  Please?
05/10/2022,Samrat Chowdhury,Please add this feature on priority
01/07/2022,Kolektivo Labs,Wtf?? no-brainer?
19/03/2022,Marek Suchanski,It blows my mind that I can't upload video assets to Webflow. Makes me wonder if there is any point continuing to use the platform.
18/02/2022,Guest,You can for example host your Website on GitHub with Stacket: https://stacket.app/ and then upload it in your GitHub Repo without any limitations and then it will appear at yourdomain.com/your-custom-file.pdf
13/01/2022,Geoff Baumbach,How is this not available? I'm forced to embed video from a third party unless it is a background video component. smh.
27/10/2021,Dan Kanvis,This feature should be a priority. It would save so much extra time and effort.
31/08/2021,Daniel Castro Maia,also assumed this was already a feature and was astounded when I discovered it wasn’t. Why is GIFs when you can use an MP4 that looks better and is an eighth of the file size? I feel like this isn’t even a day’s worth of work to implement.
11/05/2021,Nick L,Is this on Webflow's schedule to implement yet?
26/01/2021,Jon,This is such a basic must feature
10/01/2021,Joseph Graham,Hard to believe this is real. Went to add a video to my assets in the CMS editor and was shocked to learn that we can only add videos hosted elsewhere (YouTube Vimeo etc). This is awful.
31/12/2020,Ana Villarama,Update: the background video element actually works with my use case and the nice thing is the upload limit (30MB) is more than the usual image limit.
30/12/2020,Ana Villarama,Trying to build my portfolio right now and I'm running into this exact road block. I have my video files and all I want to do is place them in my page. I don't want any play bars and I don't want to create a whole new media channel just to put everything onto my own site.
09/11/2020,Dieter,Oh serious we've spend a lot of effort to create these videos there must be a way to upload these? Liking webflow a lot but this is really bad :s It's a necessity for explaining features on a modern web page.
28/07/2020,Asko Mikkola,I can't believe such a basic functionality is not implemented.
30/04/2020,Tim Kirby,We're now deep into 2020 with no sign of this on the horizon. I'm half-using Webflow and half-using Elementor Pro with Wordpress and Elementor has Webflow easily beat here.
31/03/2020,Nicolai Hemdrup,yes!!
11/11/2019,Alex Braica,Agreed. This is the only reason I am not transitioning from Semplice to Webflow.
