02/05/2022,Guest,Hello been running a ecom buissnes for a few years now. First shipping everything by normal mail (mail office only accepted handwritten postal labels so imagine the time I spent doing that.) later by a very nice but extremely expensive external fulfillment center. So for my next shipping “adventure” I would like to try to ship again. I was planning to build my new site using webflow but noticed they only had Shippo available as the shipping service. I watched a few videos online and it seemed pretty straight forward but then I tested it and shipping from Europe only allows me to log in using a already established account with the very limited couriers provided. So essentially only working as a printing service. No discounts at all. :(
