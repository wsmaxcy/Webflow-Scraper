16/12/2022,Efrain Rovira,Please this is a MUST
25/11/2022,Michael Wells,I need this often enough I added it to Sygnal's WFU webflow utils lib. Until Webflow fixes this you can add one custom attribute and one library reference to get your fields decoded. I use this all the time for soundcloud embeds in my podcasts.
15/01/2021,Ryan Sneddon,Still need this. I'm about to work through Eril's solution but this needs to be much simpler.
06/04/2020,Eril Gun Ezerel,This blog post explains how to do it. It might intimidate you at first but anyone get it done under 1 hour.https://www.wfhow.com/render-collection-custom-code-webflow/
30/01/2020,Frederik Sally,Any updates on this?
02/12/2019,William Valvo,Essential.
07/11/2019,Richard Ricketts,I was disappointed to find out this wasn't a native feature in webflow. This is a MUST! I already have several websites that I've had to find alternative solutions for because this feature was not present. PLEASE HELP!
05/08/2019,Carlos Bauza,
15/05/2019,Jenn Virskus,Yes this is SO needed!
