02/06/2022,Webflow Admin,Client Billing to be phased out via partnership with Bonsai
12/01/2022,Dhiren Sondagar,This should be a basic feature of client billing. You charge 5% for a "platform fee" surely your take on our profits can cover this basic feature. Need to bill in CAD.
30/11/2021,Sam Hudson,Please integrate this it would make a huge difference for mt aussie customers as I'm sure from other people around the world. I really love Webflow and think it has real potential in this space to dominate and having the ability to charge in native currency would add to the list of positives in using Webflow. Thanks
29/10/2021,Dr. Dominic Knape,Sooooo important! Please integrate it!
28/07/2021,Graham Barr,C'mon Webflow - how hard can this be?  Surely Stripe can assist?  This is really poor for 2021 and means anybody outside the USA can't really offer client billing. Not to mention the mess of handling Webflow bills in the accounting software.  There's an old joke in the UK about 'Yanks' who didn't realise there is a whole world outside of the USA begining to think this might be true! ðŸ˜‰
01/07/2021,William Albright,Hi Webflow team  Please comment or let us know when we will be able to invoice our clients in their native currency.    Thanks!
21/06/2021,Dave Birnie,This feature should not be difficult to add to your platform. Please add it so we can utilize payments properly to our customers. I am looking to charge in Canadian $.
24/05/2021,Vlad-Florin Iepure,Please add billing in Euro
28/04/2021,Happle Architektur,This would be a very important feature.
22/04/2021,Kevin Scholz,I would like Webflow to bill me in CADD as well
08/04/2021,Aaron Petrungaro,I would like to bill my clients in Canadian Dollars it is unprofessional having to explain that costs may vary due to conversion rates.
11/02/2021,Norman Loviat,Same for euros â‚¬â‚¬â‚¬ ! Very important !
09/12/2020,Lucy McA,SO SO important. Working with UK clients this is must. I don't want to use client billing in dollars. Webflow you should at least mention that client billing is only available for dollars.
18/08/2020,Marc Tiedemann,Yes this is very important. I just came across this problem. Webflow and we Resellers are all losing money. Some sort of statement and estimate from @webflow would be massively helpful!
12/06/2020,Craig DesBrisay,Hi @webflow. I voted on this enhancement request a couple years ago. Any thoughts on whether or not it will make it into the development roadmap soon? Thanks!
11/06/2020,Paul Novelle,This is massively important for any business selling cross border and we will need to have this functionality or have to move platforms in time
26/01/2020,Chris Lacey,I really need this feature implemented. I'veÂ currently set this up through myself allowing a fixed fee for my clients but a fluctuating fee for myself depending on the exchange rate. Being able to offer this service in poundsÂ sterling would be a massive benefit.
24/01/2020,Stuart McMorris,+1 need this. Have been asked again by my clients today.
28/11/2019,Mario GarcÃ­a de LeÃ³n,Very much needed for Europe clients.
22/08/2019,Courtney Kim,Same for our Aussie clients.
