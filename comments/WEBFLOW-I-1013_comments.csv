11/01/2023,Brent House,Count us in as another organization that would benefit from a nonprofit discount.
02/07/2021,Webflow Admin,Webflow can provide a discount for Basic CMS and Business Site Plans for twelve months and this discount can be renewed (Ecommerce Plans cannot be discounted). Please contact support@webflow.com with proof of non-profit status and ideally a link to your current site or publicity materials. We’ll then review those and get back to you.
11/03/2020,iTeams Infosys,I should add that this is for one year only.  Also if you pay annually for some plans there is almost as much discount - depending on plan.
11/03/2020,iTeams Infosys,Hey All  Webflow does offer discounts if you contact Billing and have proof of charity status.
12/02/2020,Simon Borkin,I work with nonprofits and charities in the UK and webflow is perfect for their needs but the pricing is a bit out of reach for some so a discount on costs would make it viable.
10/02/2020,Kyle Lieber,I work with a nonprofit org that helps other nonprofits solve technical problems and having a discounted rate for webflow would be great.
17/01/2020,Bonk,Please count me as another vote to offer discounted rates for registered 501(c)(3) nonprofits! As the original poster notes it's a win-win situation. It would provide a huge boost to nonprofit efforts to make the world a better place while also improving consumer views of Webflow as a company — not to mention the tax benefits. Hope 2020 will be the year of the nonprofit discount!
23/11/2019,Mike Dee,I work with a non profit that does independent films and gives them away for free. This would mean a new site for each project plus their parent org site. Non profit plans are a must please!
07/11/2019,Kendra Thompson,We would also love this! I work in a nonprofit in Canada and I'd love to use Webflow instead of Wordpress for all our websites but it is very difficult to advocate for something that's not free. Please consider offering this to Webflow then it would truly be the perfect package.
27/10/2019,Abigail Africa,I'm in this boat too! I'm a big fan of webflow and a nerd about the future of web technologies and I'm trying to convince the nonprofit I work for to switch to webflow. It's been challenging to do so because I'm passionate about this technology but it's hard to convince the team to pay for a web editor that they'd also have to learn to use.
14/04/2019,Salam Sejahtera,We would also be a huge fan of even a discount for registered 501(c)(3) non-profits! A fully-free option also isn't critical (i.e. hosting a website can cost a good bit more behind the scenes than Slack's messaging for example) but a discount would always help us pitch Webflow to our budget person who's always juggling where we can cut operating costs & overhead.We'rea registered 501(c)(3) and if needed we would be so happy to include a short mention of where our website is designed/hosted (Webflow!).
22/01/2019,Brian Singleton,I represent two different NPOs and would love to see a discounted price. I'm just learning webflow but it looks like it will fit very nicely into the nonprofit strategy of many organizations. Especially if the higher priced ecommerce packages were to be reduced. The ability to build forms for different events and get a lower payment processing fee would really be helpful.
17/01/2019,Philippe Côté,I also approve this. Webflow could be a great help to non-profit organizations!Please consider this! :)
18/04/2018,David Simpson,Most product companies include free accounts for 501(c)(3) non-profit charities I hope Webflow will join that group soon!
29/12/2017,Kasimir Suter Winter,I find myself in a very similar situation representing a non-profit organization which would greatly benefit from the capabilities of webflow but cannot afford its full website service. I too hope the webflow team will consider this request in the near future!
