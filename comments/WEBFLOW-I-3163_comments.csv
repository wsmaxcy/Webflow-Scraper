10/08/2020,Addison Leo,One of Shopify's previously unknown but useful functions is the ability to "generate" the necessary legal documents to manage your store with no more than simply adding in your business name to parentheses and changing the details a little more to the document. I will open this page. For even young entrepreneurs the importance of this service is broad.
05/08/2020,Jaylen Willingham,I am running into this issue right now! It's a project of its own to read and understand the different policies needed for a website. It's expensive to pay for policies generated by a third-party and then integrate them into Weblflow let alone if they're limited on the design customization. I really wish they had a partnership with a company like Iubenda to include in the site/ecommerce plan cost (FREE would be awesome!). If I'm creating a different site for each of my clients they will have different policies. As the webmaster and/or designer perhaps we have policy creation as an account premium service that I can apply across ALL of my projects.
