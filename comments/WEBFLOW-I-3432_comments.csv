29/03/2022,Panagiotis Tsalavrettas,Any news on this update? I am planning on building a client's store on Webflow and this is an obligatory feature in order to close the deal.
01/12/2021,Patrick Kilian,This is a dealbreaker if I move from wordpress.
01/09/2021,Tyler Brooks,Webflow please implement this feature I just launched my first digital product and tested the purchase process and it literally goes straight to where the file is hosted on DropBox - I could open the link on any other device and have access to the link.
01/01/2021,Cameron Coulby,Please please please! We need a way to generate unique links for each purchase/order!I am experiencing link sharing among my customers. Which is cutting into my sales.I love the webflow experience but this is a much needed feature!Cameron
