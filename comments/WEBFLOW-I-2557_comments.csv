24/10/2022,Adam Murray,Webflow can we get this simple Wishlist idea implemented please?
29/07/2021,Jonathan Haring,Would love this and/OR for the ability to select from existing pages created in Webflow as an option in CMS URL fields (same as in the designer/editor for static links). Manually updating nav menus across the site is a pain for both me and clients and trying to use the CMS as an easier tool for global nav management just isn't really feasible without this option.
10/05/2021,HYPE Studio,Yes needed this.
30/04/2021,Ignacio Gomez,Please webflow team do this. we really need it
06/05/2020,Umberto Pandini,This is so critical to be implemented. I'm wondering why it is not at the top of the list
