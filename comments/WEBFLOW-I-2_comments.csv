24/07/2022,Sarim Khalid,I really want to/need to write articles related to software engineering so this feature will make this possible!
09/06/2022,Georgia Rust,This is causing our team to build our blog elsewhere because most of our articles are engineering related and embedding code snippets is something we do in almost every post.
01/06/2021,Scott Sickles,This would be a huge add. Anyone writing a technical blog post will need this.

18/12/2018,Paul Jauregui,I'm obsessed with Webflow. We migrated our company website (praetorian.com) to Webflow during a redesign two years ago. Not having code syntax highlighting or the ability to insert custom code embeds within a blog post's body content is the only reason I haven't migrated our company's blog. Huge pain point.
06/09/2017,Casey Schorr,We need this for documentation! Trying to use webflow for documentation help center case studies etc - really need the ability to style as code.
14/06/2017,Jonny Hill,Many of our blog posts need this functionality.
04/02/2017,Dmitry Ratnikov,Yes please!
