24/11/2021,OUTOFOFFICE .LA,Switched over from Shopify and keep convincing myself that it was the right move but come on... No way to print customer receipts? Every customer is going to want a receipt for so many reasons. Please update this!

30/03/2021,Lucy McA,Just had a client ask for this feature. I'm shocked that this doesn't seem possible on Webflow this is a critical need for most businesses!? Please can Webflow make this a priority.
05/03/2021,Clément MURZEAU,Any updates on this feature ?

21/11/2020,Jamie Monagan,If I had known that Webflow doesn't offer printable receipts or invoices or packing slips I would have insisted by developer use a different platform. How can I run an ecommerce site and not be able to print something to enclose with orders? Please fix this immediately!
12/10/2020,Johan Carlberger,I'm almost loosing a customer because they can't print their order and order details. Any "some-what-larger" eCommerce business rarely has their stock right next to the order processing computer. They have to be able to print the order to use when running around their stock to pick the order.
