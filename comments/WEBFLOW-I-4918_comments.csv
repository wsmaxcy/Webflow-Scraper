29/07/2022,Robert Ellis,This is a big and important issue for us and many of our clients. If webflow invested in reducing emissions rather than just offsetting and put in place steps to become carbon positive this would make webflow an obvious choice over a  managed Wordpress site hosted with a planet positive web host (of which there are many).
21/07/2022,Hamish Duncan,Climate change is the challenge of our generation and will only be solved by working together. Which makes so much sense for a collaborative community like Webflow! Pressure from policy change societal pressures from activist consumers and industry disruption demands that we begin to live within our means. Consumers and governments expect businesses and brands to lead the change and prove their contribution to reducing the emissions responsible for climate change. So this is right up my strasse. The issue with many services like Webflow is that a large part of the carbon footprint lands within 'Scope 3' and outside of their direct control (i.e. Amazon Web Services - which Webflow is hosted on). Attached graphics is more generic but you get the idea hopefully.
