17/06/2022,Hamish Cooper,I'd say this whole section could benefit hugely from a redesign. You can't zoom the timeline so there's very little room to play. I get why it's a vertical layout but more room here and grouping features would be great.
20/05/2022,Ehab Hourani,
09/05/2022,Arthur Spetter,Agree!
14/02/2022,Ben Fletcher,More organization options would be great! Grouped type of interaction page etc

28/03/2020,Danijel Simon,+1 for this. It gets really confusing with all those animations.
15/03/2020,Blake Neon,Animation work need time and you must have to understand the basics of it. The https://paperwritingservice.reviews/academized-com-review/ also providing services of it and you can take course from them too.

16/05/2018,Simon Lucas,This would be amazing - a further improvement on workflow would be to not see a list of all the interactions like you have now but instead to have them available from a dropdown in a similar manner to how classes work. That way if you create a new page you might not necessarily want to see a list of all the interactions that you have created and you would not get lost. It might still be cool to have the interactions grouped somehow and visible?
08/05/2018,Simon Lucas,Sorry I meant please allow the actual folders to be re-ordered too. At the moment it is a bit annoying that I can't re-order the main interaction name that I have used. Sometimes I have related interactions but they are not in order in the list and I am not able to move them.
08/05/2018,Simon Lucas,Hi
19/03/2018,Daniel Canup,I thought this may have been a part of the last wave of updates. Any idea on the finalization of this? I know it's in development and though small it's a huge feature for me because being well organized is so very important for a smooth quick workflow :)
23/10/2017,G.J. Hunter,Yes for sure!  Would be nice to label a folder whatever you wanted to... then set multiple interactions inside by typing name or dragging actions inside the directory.  It would also be a super nice way for freelancers and Webflow to generate extra revenue because you could sell individual interactions to the community!!  Which can imported via asset manager or zip/git.  Offer them for view in the Marketplace but you would need a paying account first or need to be an approved expert to sell.  That would be a great for learning as well to observe the individual steps developers take.  See ya.
14/06/2017,Josiah Kniep,Yes please add this
04/05/2017,Joe Krug,<3
19/04/2017,Juan Manuel Garrido,+1 for this!
