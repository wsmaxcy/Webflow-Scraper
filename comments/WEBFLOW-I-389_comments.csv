04/04/2023,Jordan Connor,A list similar to the class panel would be great "Symbols affected on other pages". Just converted soem elements to symbols and can't seem to see where those classes are used anymore
24/02/2023,Nathan Lenkowski,Holy smokes is this feature needed! I've been consolidating components today and wasted a ridiculous amount of time tracking down where some older components were used. Also this feature request should be renamed to "Components with information about referenced pages" as per the recent renaming of symbols to components.
24/08/2022,Mandy Hopp,Please add this.
08/05/2022,Jayse Hansen,The lack of this feature wastes HOURS and HOURS of our time.
01/04/2021,Don Neufeld,Absolutely essential!  Shocking that this is missing.
22/03/2021,Techy Campaigner,It's hard to believe that Webflow would choose to launch Symbols without this absolutel essential functionality.
11/07/2019,Nikol' Moira,Yep this is a must!
23/02/2019,Alex Patriquin,need this so fucking bad
