10/04/2023,Tunde Williams,I will have to realize another project with Wordpress just because there is no way to integrate Twint into webflow. @webflow team: Any Update on this?

01/06/2022,Xav,TWINT IS VITAL FOR THE SWISS MARKET !!!! PLEASE add this feature.Webflow would gain so much money and attract loads of new customers to their platform just by adding a Twint plugin.Here is the link Webflow please add this:https://www.twint.ch/en/business-customers/our-solutions/online-shop/
10/05/2022,Abdul-Rahman Abbas,Please add Checkout.com for European users.
04/04/2022,Zoran Rnjakovic,Hi!
18/03/2022,Ronald Edwards,Huuuuuge need... Again I'm having a customer that counts on having TWINT as payment option and this project will again not be done with Webflow. It is a huge killer for Webflow in Switzerland at the moment!!!
14/02/2022,Ronald Edwards,We need Twint in Switzerland… this now has been a killer for over 5 projects!!!
08/02/2022,Itelium,TWINT! Please
26/01/2022,Les Tontons,Agree with the other Swiss folks here. We need Twint to convince most of our clients to go with Webflow.Strangely Switzerland is way behind when it comes to banking for the everyday customer. Not everybody has a Mastercard or Visa card simply because they are not the default card you get when opening an account. If you do ask for one there are fees left and right for obscure reasons.
11/01/2022,Aasen,Give us Vipps
17/11/2021,Studio Noue,A must for Switzerland.
12/09/2021,Uri Fleyder-Kotler,I would love to have an integration with Paddle as my preferred payment gateway.
24/07/2021,Aleena Martin,I want to add it payments option to my eCommerce website which is about 3 ply mask buyers can you check it and let me know how to start?
16/07/2021,Alessandro Kneubuehl,Hello Webflowby far Webflow is my weapon of choice when it comes to WebDesign so for. Unfortunatly i miss (too) many opportunities to do my Clients projects with webflow. The reason is simple they requiere TWINT as payment gateway. By the way i'm based in Switzerland known as the Nation of Banks. So i beg you guys for a API Plugin for TWINT. And if business is your thing think twice about those numbers.https://www.twint.ch/en/press/with-three-million-users-twint-is-on-track-to-become-the-most-popular-payment-method-in-switzerland/?lang=en
05/05/2021,Carlos Mera,South America please!!! I know there are options setting up an LLC with Stripe but it's so much of a hassle for most clients that Webflow Ecommerce is sadly not a viable option for clients in South America yet!
09/02/2021,Erwan Demenga,That would be wonderful !
28/10/2020,Obed Tewes,if only :)
06/08/2020,Stefan Jäger,Hi i love webflow and it's possibilities. But we need more Payment options for Switzerland. The famous one here is TWINT as an mobile solution. Please - they support almost every other developer-Tools:https://www.twint.ch/en/business-customers/products/plugins/We need that!
