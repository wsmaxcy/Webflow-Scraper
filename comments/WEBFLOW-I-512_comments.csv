27/04/2023,Stof Hofer,Another obviously sloppy Webflow-detail but do I hope it will get added in 2018 ðŸ™ƒ
06/05/2021,Julien Widmer,Yes a great feature would be to ad the possibility to start with "#" on link field  for that we can assign a specific sectionId to a navlink link setting in CMS which is not possible actually (or to create a specific "#section field")
01/03/2021,Derick Brown,This feature would be lovely!
10/02/2021,Livia Hamel,This would be great! For both collection pages and products/ specific CMS collections. My site is ecommerce and has specific products that we push more than others and if i want to link to that product I have to use and absolute URL that I'll have to change when I move domains for the final site.
