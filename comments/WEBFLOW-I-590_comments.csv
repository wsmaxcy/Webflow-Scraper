17/05/2023,Joon,This is basic and necessary.
10/05/2023,Tui Calvette,This is crucial for legal edits! We have to change a company term and now I have to go one by one I am so saddddd
05/04/2023,Elena V,Seems like a basic feature really need bulk find and replace
29/03/2023,David,Insane that this feature is still not here... Requested in 2018. You can't make this up.
23/01/2023,Landon Nelson,It's been nearly 6 years since this feature was requested.
04/09/2022,Calvin,Your vote counts....wait I hate politics...but this issue actually matters. HELP WEBFLOW!!!!
30/08/2022,Landon Nelson,It's crazy how this still isn't a feature!
09/08/2022,David,Is this anywhere close to being added to Webflow?
06/04/2022,Alex Dixon,+1 Would be very useful when a client would like to change a word or term they've used throughout their website content.
01/11/2021,G,Spent an hour and 45 minutes updating the phone number on a client's site ~ should've only taken 30 seconds.  Webflow we need this!
30/09/2021,Alex,I desperately need this. I built a site for a law firm and a partner left so the name has to change ASAP. Each of nearly 500 pages has multiple in-text references to the firm name (let's say Alpha Beta Gamma Law) and the abbreviation (ABG Law.) I hate Wordpress but it does have multiple plugins that would make this a 5 minute job instead of 5 days.
07/12/2020,Skello,Find & Replace within the CMS would be great (to make URL bulk changes)
03/08/2020,Farid Chaouki,Find & Replace external URLs would be amazing!
02/03/2020,Dustin Reed,Yes please. Ultimately a control that allowed for options/filtering:
01/02/2020,Oliver Windham-Wright,Yeh really need this asap please!
30/01/2020,Jason Roach,Yes please. Ultimately a control that allowed for options/filtering:F&R by Page vs. CMS Text vs. SitewideF&R Alt TextF&R Class NamesF&R ID NamesF&R Div AttributesF&R Asset Filenames
26/09/2019,Andrew Suffill-Boyes,This functionality would be incredibly beneficial enough to vote with a +3.
18/04/2019,Brent Harrison,love this idea fo sho
03/04/2019,John Rinkenberg,Agreed 100%!!!!
12/03/2019,Miek Thompson,I must have this feature.
