24/03/2019,Kevin LÃ¶ffler,With iOS 12 now supporting USDZ Files directly in the browser even previewing 3D Models in AR on a users iPhone it would be great to have a USDZ Element which you could simply drag and drop onto the canvas instead of working with a code embed. Additionally it would be super slick to be able to upload USDZ files directly in Webflow.
