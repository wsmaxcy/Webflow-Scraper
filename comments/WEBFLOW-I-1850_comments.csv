03/12/2020,Jenny Bounmivilay,+3 all the way. It's been an absolute pain connecting my blogs and that's with only 3 entries up at the moment T_T
29/08/2020,Ben Drechsel,Can't we at least get a "Pro hack" that we could append to a custom link like .../?item=next or something?
02/06/2020,Freeflo Studios,We really need this essential feature added!
02/05/2020,Matt Brodersen,Migrating my company's blog from WP to Webflow. This is such a basic feature... I thought it already existed. I want the ability to show the next post at the bottom of each post page. Damn.
17/02/2020,Suka Nobi,Thank you for providing this interesting and fascinating information. You can experience many interesting games here: online jigsaw puzzles

12/01/2020,Dan Chen,This is a huge feature for me. Many of my clients have blogs/portfolios and this is a major plus for them.

21/02/2019,Jen Armstrong,Sidenote I can't vote for my own idea because I am unable to remove my votes from items that have already shipped. I've had this issue for a long time (6 months to a year). When I click on the vote the dropdown is empty. Just FYI.
