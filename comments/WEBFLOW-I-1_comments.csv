15/03/2023,Benedikt Dreier,We desperately need this as well. It is a necessary feature for every bigger agency.
09/03/2022,Edward Vizard,NEED THIS please! Why is this taking so long?
06/02/2022,Brandon McKay,What is taking so long?
25/01/2022,Brandon Holt,Makes it incredibly difficult to manage Dark Matter Digital's clients who want designer access.
19/01/2022,Joe Hohman,In my opinion this is the biggest limitation for using the Webflow platform in an agency environment.
15/01/2022,mBusiness GmbH,How difficult could it possibly be to develop this feature? We are really losing patience with Webflow.
15/01/2022,mBusiness GmbH,Knowing the Webflow team it could be as little as 5 years before this idea is tested. They prefer to invest their money in funny videos.
14/01/2022,Blott Software,Need Desperately!
28/10/2021,Josh Hoeg,Is this in progress? I seriously need this functionality
25/09/2021,Matt Banton,Defiantly a crucial feature! My clients need it makes it harder to sell Webflow to them without it.
04/08/2021,Tim Daff,This is the single most important new feature I need to expand my business on Webflow.@webflow
16/07/2021,Phil Baker,At a minimum this feature should have shipped with the enterprise edition. Security at the account level makes zero sense in a large enterprise
07/07/2021,Marget Long,NEED THIS!!!!  People have been asking for this since 2016...will this happen?  And when??? Will make or break our ability to put large client on webflow.
23/05/2021,HYPE Studio,Team plan members share the same access right to all folders and projects.Inviting external designers and developers exposes huge vulnerability risks.
03/05/2021,Henrik Lindstr√∂m,This!!! Webflow has fast become the go-to tool for all of our smaller web projects. The lack of user specific editor permissions is pretty much the only thing standing in the way of taking our bigger clients here as well.Please hurry with this one as it wouldn't really just be a nifty feature but is absolutely key in terms of credibility and gdpr.Upon shipping this soooo many WP sites will be coming your way fast!
21/04/2021,David Jemison,Desperately needed.
13/04/2021,Rheed MacPherson,Pleeeeeeeeease!
06/03/2021,The Armory,Would like this feature
05/03/2021,Farooq Malik,Really need this
21/01/2021,TIN DEVELOPERS,This is of paramount importance we work with many freelancers and it is not practical to give unfettered access to each person.
