31/05/2023,HELPY Media,We switched all our Mailchimp accounts to MailerLite would love to have a direct integration to Webflow!!
31/03/2023,Miles Mitchell,Wanted to switch over from ConvertKit to MailerLite but I'll have to waittttt :(
10/02/2023,Wouter Trappers,pretty please
22/01/2023,Conrad X,Definitely need MailerLite. Webflow and MailerLite are the best options for most new businesses so it's such a shame Webflow doesn't have this integration. Please can we create this ASAP?
05/01/2023,Nicolas Vanlerberghe,Would be great if mailerlite got integrated!
17/11/2022,Mike Shaefer,Pleeeease create this integration. Thanks.
04/11/2022,REAPER Tips,Need this :(
19/09/2022,Lieve,Yes would love this! Any news on it?
09/09/2022,Kayley,Cmonnnn. I was so set on using Webflow and MailerLite to set up my new biz but realising there is no integration sucks :(
22/08/2022,Fuzen Co.,Still nothing. The fact we can’t use the onClick even in Webflow really sucks because then we could easily attach to a button to spawn the pop-up. There’s a script in the forum that is supposed to allow for it but I’ve never gotten it to work. Ugh.
17/08/2022,Bill,Is it still not supported? And can you use the free version of zapier?
04/03/2022,Pedro Erthal,100% supported.
17/02/2022,Randy Garmon,I couldn't agree more. I will throw a party the day that MailerLite is integrated!
21/01/2022,Skott Mellins,
