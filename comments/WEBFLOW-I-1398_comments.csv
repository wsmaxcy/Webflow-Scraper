28/09/2021,Jayse Hansen,Just joined Webflow and from what I've seen they're doing their absolute best to keep hosting super limited (cheap) on their end. (yet they charge a super premium for it! haha) This is reflected in the 1995-era low upload limits (4MB files). So I highly doubt they want any videos to be hosted in any way shape or form. (30MB limit is astoundingly low and makes the videos look awful unless they're tiny and about 2 seconds in length.) They weren't very transparent about it. I would have considered a different platform had I known this.
