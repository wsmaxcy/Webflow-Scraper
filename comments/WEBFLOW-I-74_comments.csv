31/05/2023,Joe Shashati,Use cases for this are pretty limitless. Feels backwards that this feature is not available. This would also allow us to create secondary pages from within the collection template. For example a collection item would generate two pages one that is the main landing page and second with a call to action that you can access from the first. Currently it looks like I have to manually create those pages every time a collection item is recorded. I see about 400 people wanting this feature why is it still not available?
23/03/2023,Axel Vaindal,This is clearly mandatory in order to create programmatic SEO pages and target multiple keywords combination based on CMS items data.
15/03/2023,Chris Guest,This would be helpful to allow an editor to input content once that feeds two different pages and use cases with the same slug for predictability.Consider a restaurant database that has a /location/[slug] page for potential diners to find a restaurant then a different page /thankyou-offer/[slug] to show an offer or discount code to people that DID dine there.An editor listing a new restaurant could make one CMS entry listing both the name and address of the restaurant for the location finder view and the discount code and thank you offer at the same time.Then two different template pages could pull their relevant fields from the same CMS collection item but have the SAME SLUG but with a DIFFERENT PATH.For example.eat.com/locations/mamma-miaeat.com/thankyou-offer/mamma-miaThe reason this is valuable is that at the moment the editor creates the restaurant listing both pages are created without double entry or risk of forgetting to create one or the other.Also the URL structure and slug is predictable so if any external software points to this content it can deduce the /thank-you/ slug address from the /locations/ slug for each item and vice-versa.
08/03/2023,Michael Moran,Please this would be so helpful as I am trying to make regional templates and links for versions for every item in a collection
16/11/2022,Michael Egner,This is much needed in my opinion. Been a while since this started!
19/10/2022,Aurimas Slapšys,We need this functionality to create a custom summary of the page and print it as PDF and different designs for some portions of the collections
11/10/2022,Christopher Dell,We need to have SEO pages for each of clients PER collection. Unusable to not have this.
15/09/2022,Peter Robineau,This is a HUGE PAIN POINT. Please fix this or we need to cancel our subscription and look for other solutions.
11/08/2022,Remo Moser,Please make this happen
24/07/2022,John Thorne,What's the point of a CMS if the records can only be viewed on a single page??
11/05/2022,Kelsie Thomas,Is this going anywhere? I'm working with users with low tech literacy who sometimes want to print pages and I'd like to make a "print-friendly" version of my collection template. The website also needs to exist in two languages and I was hoping to have one collection (so my org partner can input the English and Spanish at the same time/in the same place) with an English and Spanish version of the collection template. This could also be used for light/dark modes. I really hope y'all are considering this!
23/03/2022,Cookies & MILK,yeah this is ridiculous. How can you launch an eCommerce builder without multiple product page types? Clearly it shows you only care about single merchant stores and we should look elsewhere for serious solutions.
11/11/2021,Robert Turner,I agree. @webflow if you want to compete with wordpress on cms or watch cms clients defect do this already.
17/12/2020,Roy Wilkie,I was honestly pretty shocked when I got to the point in using CMS features for the first time to see that not only is a 'collection page' created arbitrarily that you can only copy & paste content into but that one page is the only one you get to have.
27/10/2020,Renato Carvalho,I have mini courses database with materials and videos. I display everything on my website but only a few are available for non members. I would like to display the same database with all the materials and videos on another page which is shown only for members in another URL. I'm using memberstack for that.
29/06/2020,His Royal Meatbag Seph Reed,I was annoyed in the first place that it creates the CMS page "auto-magically" the moment you create a CMS.  It was totally unexpected behavior impossible to predict.   That you can't have any control at all and have to expect irrational behavior combined shows that this is a very broken part of the UX.
05/02/2020,Erik selmanovic,I would love this but for different languages. I would like to set up a collection with fields for each language then having these templates showing just one language. So in my case three templates per collection (Swedish English Serbo-Croatian)
02/12/2019,William Valvo,I need this for Articles. I have multiple article types with essentially the same content that require different treatments. For example standard articles vs features. The core content is the same but features need a different more dramatic layout. That said I would like to load them all (both featured and standard articles) into one grid on a homepage for example. I am shocked and disappointed this is not possible although I may be missing the correct workaround.
10/04/2019,John T.,I spent so much time building the site to realize just now that we cannot do this :(
15/08/2018,Nick Fry,This also moves closer to solving the issue of not being able to feature more than one collection type in a collection grid. For example: if we build a landing page a blog page and a normal page layout but want to create a featured grid on the homepage. We can only feature one page type per collection.
