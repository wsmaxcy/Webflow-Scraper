11/10/2020,Andre Sottil,What's the status with this request? Also Dylan's description is perfectably understandable.
12/05/2017,Ellias Rezaie,thought this was a basic field option....guess not.
06/02/2017,Michael Kadron,This is a good idea. Â I think that he means having a "Unique" checkbox next to certain fields in the field designer that dictates that a CMS entries' value for that field can't already exist in the CMS database.
03/02/2017,Dylan Johnston,Updated Sorry for the vague description!
03/02/2017,Webflow Team,Hey Dylan can you explain further? The description isn't very clear. Can you also include a specific use case?
