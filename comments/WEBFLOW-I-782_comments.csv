01/03/2023,Pavel,come on @webflow
16/02/2023,Tony Peacock,Please add this it is important to SEO
29/07/2022,Adam Hayes,If your team adds this I will get a Webflow tattoo on my forehead
28/03/2022,Graham Cox,Hi @webflow
16/12/2021,Yesbaby,Any update?
31/07/2021,Bradley Williams,Hey guys any update on this? Is it in the pipeline? Correct me if I'm wrong but is this not super simple to implement? In the same way as implementing the "open in new tab" button was when building the CMS. If so it's going to be a HUGE reason why bloggers will never sign up to use Webflow to manage their site.
28/07/2021,Branden Harvey,Google is about to start getting mad at us. so this is really important.
13/07/2021,Simon,This is needed Webflow. Especially for people who manage blogs. The CMS is great but features like this are important!
12/07/2021,Rajagopalan C,This is a really basic feature for SEO. It's quite inconvenient when essential functionality are missing. It should be implemented ASAP!
03/06/2021,Team Merci,We need this please!
24/03/2021,Emil Simeonov,This is a basic feature that should be added ASAP...
24/03/2021,Jessica Belvedere,This needs to be implemented ASAP - it hurts SEO and we should be able to have control over this small control.
12/10/2020,Evgeniy Gusarov,The fact that Webflow offers a CMS for people to manage blogs but does not include nofollow controls is ridiculous. It makes running a blog focused website really useless.
09/09/2020,Marta Piotrowiak,This is ridiculus that Webflow doesn't support nofollow and other atributes.
28/08/2020,James Oliver,Is there a date on this? I cant believe you cant no follow links on posts haha
