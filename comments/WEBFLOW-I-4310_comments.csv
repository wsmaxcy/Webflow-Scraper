28/12/2022,Brittany,Same.  Id love the ability to input 4 or 5 colors and there would be a drop down on the cms side for that color so no hex code selection.

21/06/2021,Webflow Admin,Thank you for submitting your idea! Could you explain in a bit more detail? When you say "create a select" do you mean a form select field?
