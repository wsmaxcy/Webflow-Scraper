Especially considering the promo video for the feature seems to give the impression that the Touch icon would be optimized it's clearly not going to be. Imagine having multiple inputs where each had a pixel value and you upload and it formats the PNG with the right filename prefix/suffix. I want my icons to look great at the very least on iPhone!
