16/03/2023,Russell Van Lieshout,This would be very helpful for portfolio driven sites for artists etc.
13/11/2020,Henk Baetsen,I would like this feature very much. Not only for the background color but also for styling of arrows close-btn size padding etc... When you're styling a bright fresh and clean housestyle a black light-box for the local undertaker doesn't really contribute ;-)
28/05/2019,Abel Garcia,Please I need this feature So I can change the background color of the gallery widget thank you!!
10/09/2018,Didacus Jones,HAA (not laughing just clearing my throat) bro interactions 2.0 can run that like no mans business - press the button with eye patch and push everything by 100% when not in view...etc etc you know what I mean
03/04/2017,Steven,I second this x infinity
