29/09/2021,Kaleb - Webflow Developer Australia,SOLVED: Finsweets new Chrome extension allows you to do this >> https://www.finsweet.com/extension/ üëçüèº
05/08/2021,Renaud Futterer,YES
31/07/2021,Aaron Ward,God yes simple drag and drop to reposition would be perfect.
30/04/2021,Ben Barrett-Forrest,This would be so valuable!
30/04/2021,Kaleb - Webflow Developer Australia,Yes pllleeease
23/04/2021,Russell Gathright,This is almost stupid this feature doesn't exist.
14/04/2021,Visual Finesse,4 years later and we still don't have this...
01/04/2021,Danilo Leicht,I find this feature very important for daily organization. Figma has solved this well.
06/12/2020,Valentin Ffrench,This is very important !Having the possibility either to reorder them (drag and drop) or order them by name. Use Case: I've started a project with Main colors (Primary secondary etc.)Only latter on I went and added 4 shades per colors. I need those colors to be grouped by their name (naming convention) or at least being able to reorder the global swatches by hand. As of today it's easy to create something but very painful to evolve and/or maintain it. I'm surprise this is not something the Webflow Team has implemented by default with their attention to UX. Looking forward to see Webflow polishing this feature.
02/12/2020,Will Qu,This would be great! Surprised it's not a feature yet
18/11/2020,Clint Haas,Yes please!
25/08/2020,Graham Barr,Agree - this would make the evolution of a project so much easier especially when handing the project over to clinet.  Its nice to have everything in order. It can't be that hard to implement surely?
16/05/2020,Jonathan Holden,So important in building design systems / templates
13/05/2020,Morten Sordahl,missing this feature!
18/03/2020,Tye Newton,Yes please! I came here to suggest this myself.

01/10/2019,Vesper Sinclair,I second what Chris Meeks said. The ability to organize color swatches is crucial for maintaining a neat efficient design system and it's a feature I use heavily in my Adobe programs.
13/06/2019,TRUE,Absolutely needed. I'm also working on a multi colour project and it's annoying to not at least be able to re-order swatches. Even better would be the ability to gave folders or at least line breaks to group them better.
12/06/2019,Chris Meeks,This is one of those things that's very important when trying to maintain any sort of style guide or design system within a project. For instance if you start with three global grey swatches and then add a fourth much later in the project there is no way for them to appear together sequentially.
14/12/2017,Andi,This would be a great improvement especially when working with styleguide templates and larger projects.
