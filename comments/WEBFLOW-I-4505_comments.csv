20/10/2021,Lions Creative,I'm surprised this isn't a more popular vote. I guess most people are building on individual accounts so thats where the majority is but being able to transfer a project with active hosting to a client would be such a useful addition. I know Editor X can do this but everything else about Editor X compared to Webflow is just sub par. The only solution to this is to transfer the project before you go live with it which isn't always the route we want to go with all of our clients.
