10/02/2017,Tyler Harvey,I would prefer to be able to simply upload videos as assets so that you can use transparent videos or motions graphics without making them background images that have no options or controls.
18/01/2017,Matthew Sanderson,There are loads of parameters for YouTube (and many for Vimeo) – autoplay is one I use a lot usually by manually adding: ?autoplay=1 to the end of the URL – but I agree the ability to do this via a simple checkbox would be helpful.
