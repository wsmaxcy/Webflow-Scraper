21/03/2021,Nicole Cmar,Is there any word on this yet? This is a must for most blogs and I would love to have an easy way to make some posts span columns to be easier on viewers eyes.
01/03/2021,Gianfranco Suito,this would be extremely useful and I agree with other people saying that there should be more options to change columns in CMS grids.
20/08/2018,Alborz Heydaryan,this should also work perfectly with items of different height. having a fixed width limitation is understandable.
20/08/2018,Alborz Heydaryan,I just went through all of the available forum posts for masonry grid. but they all fall in one or two categories or rely on custom code that doesn't work really well. One thing that none of the solutions address is having the number of columns being dynamic based on the width of the browser. 4 presets isn't enough. I want the number to change dynamically between 1 and as many as fits properly. if someone opens the page on a 27" iMac I don't want 4 columns. I want 8! also horizontal sorting is missing. it goes down in columns. not acceptable in many cases. people don't read websites column by column. they do the F pattern of scanning a webpage. columsn just goes 100% against this. HUGE over sight in my opinion.
13/06/2018,Roarke Clinton,This has been around forever on Wordpress
12/06/2018,Roarke Clinton,PLEASE!
02/01/2018,Nein,Would be awesome if this would be made a feature in webflow!
05/08/2017,Pyramid City,Yes please!
21/04/2017,Robert Stammen,Please make it sort the content/pics horizontally and give it the ability to filter ( e.g. buttons above the gallery grid) the displayed content (e.g. CMS Content Categories).
05/04/2017,Marius Jurtz,Great idea!
