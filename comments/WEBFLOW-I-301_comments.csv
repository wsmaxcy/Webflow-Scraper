22/01/2023,Chase Charaba,I can't believe this isn't a feature! You can do this easily with WordPress HubSpot and other platforms.
27/07/2022,Nikita Vyutnov,I'd be great to have this feature. Ar the moment I do a complicated setup using individual rich-text blocks for each anchor + I need to add a separated filed for each block as an anchor text. If there are more then 10 rich-text fields in the article I'm getting closer to limit of 30 fields at all in one CMS item.
