07/08/2022,Michael Wells,For anyone needing this now you can add this support using showdown.js and a bit of jQuery. You can place your markdown code inside of HTML Embeds which are now supported inside of Richtext content and can be stored in the CMS.
15/07/2022,William Ruiz Morales,This would be great less marketing more markdown Vlad!
11/02/2022,Evan Frawley,Hey everyone! I had this EXACT same problem. So I build a chrome extension to convert markdown that is copy/pasted into the rich text field :) Here's the link: https://www.fake.so/magicpaste
03/11/2021,Clayton Dukes,PLEASE PLEASE do this. My company is migrating to Webflow and this is now a 100% show-stopper for us. The current editor is absolutely horrific. We can't even add ordered lists.
04/05/2021,Alex Lazar,This would be really helpful especially when you use Zapier and getting text from other apps.
04/03/2021,Gianfranco Suito,please. please. please. do this!
26/12/2020,Dávid Lévai,Fully into it! It'd really help. The current Rich text editor is too simple. Markdown should help. Especially with syntax highlighting in rich text.
11/10/2020,Serverless Guru,Hey there this is really critical to have markdown support we were planning to do a massive migration from Medium to Webflow for all of our blog content and push them into webflow using markdown format.
09/07/2020,Shane O'Donnell,did anything happen with this?
10/11/2019,Gael Blanchemain,and still no response? It's been 2 years now. Are you guys at Workflow too busy selling "business integration" to take care of your actual users? (devs)
01/09/2019,Neil Taylor,Helps when drafting on iOS and other text editors or when collaborating...
11/01/2019,Alexandre S.,Completely a must-have as we can spread the same text on several different platforms
06/11/2018,Jean-Pierre Stopinski,Due to markdowns recent popularity spike i fully support this!Take care when implementing the syntax though due to various common "flavors" or "interpretations".Would be awsm if CMS compatible!
