27/02/2023,Sai Natarajan,Going to add my voice here to the many musicians/producers/composers that require an audio player to showcase their work on their website. I've been using a custom open source audio player myself but it's very buggy on mobile and it has very limited features. YouTube and SoundCloud embedding simply doesn't cut it â€“ they're unsightly (no really they look awful) they significantly slow down the website loading times and they tend to recommend completely irrelevant content. We're also not interested in paying third party services for this functionality when it should've been a base feature right from the beginning.
09/11/2022,Ian Ruta,Hello! We are working on an audio player that can be customized in the Webflow designer and dynamically play audio file links from the CMS. Our solution will be no-code and take minutes to minutes add to your site:
18/08/2022,Greg Willits,Please add this ASAP. I'm attempting to move my multiple podcast series over to webflow.  Successfully moved almost 1400 episodes over into my CMS only to discover there is no native way to dynamically reference the enclosure URLs for each podcast episode.  Desperately need a way to play the episode for each individual MP3 URL (not placing an individual player one at a time and manually inputting the URL to the MP3).
08/08/2022,Guest,I love this blog because it shares free songs. I have downloaded a lot of great songs here. I often send to work outdoors so want to listen to music while working. These songs can be used as ringtones for calls to samsung phones Tonos123.Com

02/01/2022,David Pearl,Let's make this happen please Webflow - it would be amazing to natively embed audio files! As audio becomes a bigger part of a web-browsing experience not natively supporting this audio files becomes more of an issue.
25/12/2021,Judith,Yes please! All bands/musicians need this!
06/12/2021,David Martens,Let's get it made!
08/10/2021,Bernie January Jr,The time has come. This would truly be a necessary/stand out feature given the growing number of podcasters indy bands and musicians looking to build or have a designer help them create a unique brand and audio-based website experience.
09/04/2021,Grant Tolson,Webflow please make this. We all desperately want audio players on our websites without messing with/paying for third party applications that then have to be embedded.
04/01/2021,Doug,Absolutely. I'm constantly impressed with all the thought that has gone into Webflow. So I'm astonished that audio player functionality is not there!
10/12/2020,Lucy McA,Very much needed. Client is currently doing this on their Squarespace site and feels backwards that Webflow can't.
30/09/2020,Charles Hoffman,My music production blog would find this very useful. Been waiting on this feature for a few years now.
09/09/2020,Harry Lang,please please please!
09/09/2020,Plumillon Forge,We need this why video and not audio ?
14/08/2020,Andrew B,YES! YES! YES!
19/07/2020,Nin*Kaz,I love messing around with Webflow and I'd kill to be able to catalog all my music there too. I'm shocked that this isn't available yet considering how even basic website builders such as Weebly have this functionality.
23/06/2020,Alan Mannion,Not having access to sound is very short sighted. Come on guys this should not be rocket science. Having a video feature for uploading background video. Got it. Why not have an audio upload feature.
09/06/2020,Charlotte Germann,Yes please!
15/05/2020,Esteban German,super needed! please :)
