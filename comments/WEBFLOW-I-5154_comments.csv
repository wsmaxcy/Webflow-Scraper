24/11/2022,Diamond Dan,I agree 100 percent with this. Having an option to cancel auto renew on a webflow site plan is such a basic feature that webflow lacks. Furthermore having the site plan cancel immediately even if you have payed for 1 month makes it even harder to cancel a website if you don't need it after a month or two. Are we supposed to keep track of when we started a siteplan on a calendar to come back and cancel it 1 day before the auto renew? So ridiculous. These kinds of "money grabby" techniques from Webflow makes me want to stop using it. Very unfortunate.
