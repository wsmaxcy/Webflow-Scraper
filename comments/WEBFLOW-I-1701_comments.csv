14/02/2023,Edward Bentley,﻿I love using Webflow but I wasn't aware that the emails aren't part of the hosting package I didn't know that was a thing. That's the one element I need for my clients. No email is a deal breaker for me. I got to be able to offer my clients multiple emails with the hosting package.
12/02/2020,Mar Perez,Super agree!!
04/01/2020,Media for Minds,Hosting with free email from some of the biggest providers is offered via cPanel not in the same class at all with Webflow experience and too technical for clients. Premium and managed email is an additional charge but actually possible for a client to access.
27/12/2019,Alex Cheng,Please have this available I'm running into issues with clients who are questioning our WF's hosting because now we need to switch their emails and make them pay for emails. Not to mention backing up all their current emails.
12/02/2019,Luis Suarez,we need this so much...like NOW.
10/01/2019,IWOO,Moreover this is the only reason I don't use the domain registration tool with Webflow admin panel. Then i lose my email options if I don't want to go with G-suite. If we could use email accounts with WF that would solve that problem.
