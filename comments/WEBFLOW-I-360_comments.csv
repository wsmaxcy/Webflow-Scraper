27/10/2021,Colin Simmons,I'm shocked this hasn't been implemented particularly for CMS applications. As Rijk already mentioned Squarespace has had this for years and it works very well.
23/12/2019,Rijk van Wel,Squarespace has a very nice 'focal point' based implementation.
02/09/2018,Jaime Gil,This is very needed! Every image has a different focal point. It's annoying for editors not to be able custom-crop BG images through the CMS. Other platforms like Squarespace have implemented this feature already.
