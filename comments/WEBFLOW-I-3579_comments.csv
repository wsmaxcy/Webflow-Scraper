10/05/2022,Abdul-Rahman Abbas,This is extremely key! Need to be able to partially refund them and send an adjusted receipt showing the partial refund and the new total.
01/11/2021,Rhys Dyson,I did a partial refund through PayPal as I set up the pricing/shipping costs wrong within Webflow and that marked the entire order within Webflow as "refunded" meaning that any other management of this order and emails are all going to be lost now.
05/07/2021,Phil Holt,Completely agree - this is standard functionality that must be included.
04/06/2021,All Skinwear,This is so important please fix this asap as this is such un important part of an e-commerce and our customers get so upset with our way of working partial refunds!!
01/06/2021,Wai Phyo,It is such an important part of Ecommerce order process and every other providers are doing it. I am not sure how this issue is still not fixed ??
28/04/2021,Angie Farrugia,Please add this one - including refunding by a dollar amount not just by product.

07/12/2020,Joel,How on earth did eCommerce get shipped without this feature of partial refunds!? It's such as common use case.
