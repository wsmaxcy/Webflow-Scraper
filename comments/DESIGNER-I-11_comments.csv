10/02/2023,Carlos G Arroyo,I see that a merged idea we to track orders from client. As an ECOMMERCE product from webflow it should be a must. I activated "users" beta but has nothing to do with that idea.
16/12/2022,Yanick Laverdure,Please. I would be so happy to have conditional visibility on item to be conditional on group users are in and not only if they are logged or not. By the way user/membership functionality is awesome! Maybe not 100% about it but would appreciate to be able to trigger email notification when a user change its profile information are when a new user is registered on my site.
31/10/2022,Rob MacDonald,GDPR Compliance please! :)
06/09/2022,Daniel,Thanks so much for working on this!
13/07/2022,Lou Mulet,Would be very useful to add custom fields to the Users collection settings that aren't just plain text. The same the CMS ones would be awesome!
08/07/2022,Vania Rensi,Concept: Listing directory (real estate hotels restaurants etc.)
14/06/2022,Engineering Team,Will webflow give the option to enable SSO with other platforms. If yes how can we register our platform for the same
02/06/2022,Brandon Welsh,Does anybody know when this feature will become live on Webflow?
31/05/2022,HYPE Studio,Is the Membership 1 feature upcoming also going to deal with the missing customer accounts feature in eCommerce 1? ...so that customers can check their purchases again or even download digital items again by logging into the website.
30/05/2022,HYPE Studio,So... seeing https://wishlist.webflow.com/ideas/WEBFLOW-I-1524 merged into this.
24/04/2022,ANDRES MENARD,Do we know when this feauture will be roling out to everyone?
04/04/2022,Esther,Is the memberships feature going to give the possibility to create a community platform as well?
27/03/2022,Robert Holtz,Native functionality for Memberships is coming soon to Webflow and from what I've seen from previews it's gonna be great. That said no release date has been officially announced yet so it's still not clear exactly when we will get these tools in our hands or how robust they will be when they're first released. That's why my advice for anyone that has a Webflow project that needs membership features RIGHT NOW you MUST check out Memberstack. It's designed to integrate seamlessly with Webflow sites and has been in production on real world member websites for years now. I believe it will remain a great member access solution for many Webflow designers and site owners for years to come. Here's a direct link I've set up for you to a page explaining exactly how Memberstack works for Webflow users. You can be up and running TODAY. I highly recommend you check it out: https://www.memberstack.com/with/webflow?via=robert
04/03/2022,Sam Hewa Nalagamage,Is there any update on the release date?
28/02/2022,Demetris Roumis,status update on this?
11/02/2022,Riley Brown,It's been about 5 months since I first heard about this entering beta. I know these things take time to get right. To everyone here begging for a release date just know that it is very unlikely for a company as large as Webflow to put out news about a release until it's knocking at the door. If you haven't heard anything about an official release date on membership functionality it's likely to be at the very least a few months away if not longer. They need to build the tool test it fix it produce video content to educate people on how to use it etc. It's kind of a big deal! I know we've all been waiting for years but I wouldn't hold your breath just yet.If you happened to get into beta I hope it's going well. We're all very eager to see something.
11/02/2022,Eric Llouquet,What is the timeline for official release?
04/02/2022,Eli Stawicki,Anything on the timeline? Is this 10 years out? 1 Year 6 Months? And why is the bata open if you never let us join?
29/01/2022,P K,Why did this take 6 years to roll out? Was originally submitted in 2016 and it is now Jan 2022 and the basic ability for users to login and out still isn't live for all users. What is the point of this wishlist if it takes years for any features to be added?
27/01/2022,Danila Mouzytchenko,Without proper handling of the GDPR problem it is unusable in the EU.
