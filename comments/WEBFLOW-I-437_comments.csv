04/04/2023,Thomas Nathan,Yes please! It's becoming a tedious to find workarounds for so many issues like this one.
09/02/2022,Brandon Holt,We are having the same problem.
25/05/2019,Ami Arroyo,Would love to see this feature added. I have a site with background videos as headers (wordpress site) and the theme I'm using supports video on mobile devices. And idea when this feature will be added?
09/11/2018,Matt Richardson,This would really help my project. I have an MP4 file which I've reduced down to 127kb and it looks great but it won't centre properly on mobile. I have learned that I must use a gif but even withÂ significant effort I can not get the gif below 400kb and the quality of it is dreadful. I give this a hard and heavy vote.
18/01/2018,David Burchett,Anyone know of a workaround for this?
05/04/2017,Aaron Ybarra,please and thank you.
27/02/2017,Ntchi,That would be great.
