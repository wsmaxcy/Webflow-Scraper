08/02/2023,INAGREAT,Yeah they should allow us to truncate anywhere right in the style settings. It would be so simple and solve many problems.
13/05/2022,Ian Sampaio,It should offer general truncate (eg: text-overflow: ellipsis ) for CMS but also paragraph text block and so on.
11/07/2020,Mitchell A.,I just ran into this issue. This would be great.
