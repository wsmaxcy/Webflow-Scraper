15/06/2022,Max Wilson,Very hard to use Webflow in Argentina without local payments
18/11/2021,Marco González,Is Paypal a good alternative? it works worldwide but I dont know if we could consider it a "solution"
30/06/2021,Carlos Mera,The best way to make this more accessible for everyone therefore getting more and more users on the Webflow train would be to open it to connect other payment options!
05/05/2021,Carlos Mera,Yes please!!! I know there are options setting up an LLC with Stripe but it's so much of a hassle for most clients that Webflow Ecommerce is sadly not a viable option for clients in South America yet!
25/02/2021,Franco Ruarte,One of my clients in Argentina can't pay. They will move to another platform because of this. So sad.
