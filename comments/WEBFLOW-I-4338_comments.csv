29/03/2023,í”ŒëŸ­ì„œìŠ¤,RIVE is many times better than LOTTIE and you can improve the quality of your website by leaps and bounds just by applying it.
17/03/2023,Claudio M,Agree that would be amazing!
05/03/2023,P F,We want Rive!
09/02/2023,Miles Mitchell,This would make Webflow projects even more magical then they already are ðŸª„
03/02/2023,Webmaster Hive,This would be super useful. Use AE for creating micro-animations is like using Photoshop to design UIs.
31/01/2023,Patrik Leng,Im a new web designer and Im loving webflow. But then I see how easy it is to integrate riv file into framer it makes me think of switching to framer. Please make webflow perfect by this simple thing. Thank you!

02/12/2022,Emile Jansen,yes please
28/11/2022,Dale Janzen,Adding native Rive animation support would be SO very useful now and open up a lot of additional wonderfulness going forward! Sooner than later please.
22/11/2022,Rolans Kims,Rive provides interactivity Lottie cannot have - by design. A deeper integration with Rive would be very helpful for things like micro-interactions.

18/11/2022,Chadwick Dewey,I agree our current website uses RIVE's animaiton embeded into the website which is great but the animaiton are a little slow to load and there aren't as many integration opportuntities. Webflow its time to upgrade!
