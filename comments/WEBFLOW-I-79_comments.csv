25/05/2022,Luca,Please allow an option to download all invoices for the whoel year in one PDF or at least aggregated by Quarter so I don't have to download 20 different docs and cosolidate them together when I have to do the tax declaration
14/12/2021,Colton Bowshier,This is a nightmare - please please please fix this soon. Accounting is all over me.
18/10/2021,Daniel Mohn-Reinaas,I'm soon paying more to my accountant for all the administration than to webflow. Please fix this.
04/02/2021,Daniel Dimitrov,It's unfortunetly imposible to manage both our team account billings let alone all of our clients billings coming in at different points during the month. It would be very useful and appreciated to have the option to control when rebilling takes place say choose what day each month. PLEASE introduce this feature very soon! -- We're fighting an uphill battle that shouldn't need to be fought.
28/01/2021,Tania Fauvel,The invoicing system is an absolute mess. Hire and accountant to get basics sorted. It is impossible currently to track anything.
19/07/2018,Torkel Vikeby,My company is closing in on 100 published websites. And are having a difficult time keeping track of all the invoices that are coming in on seperate dates. We really want to get the invoices all togheter on a given date either once a month or twice a year.
25/04/2017,Patrik Strandell,This would definetly make invoices from webflow seem more reliable and professional I would like this!
28/02/2017,Koen Spaansen,Maybe its a better idea that the clients can see the PDF in their CMS?
18/01/2017,Koen Spaansen,This is really needed! i can't mail all that monlty PDF's to my customers by hand or do i?
