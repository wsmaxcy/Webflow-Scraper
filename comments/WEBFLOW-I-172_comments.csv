15/12/2022,Patrick MW,Why is this not already a thing?
09/11/2022,Alex Bass,This would make my life SO much easier honestly shocked it still doesn't seem to exist? Makes creating many more complex landing pages incredibly difficult.
06/09/2022,Goldyn Daupin,Definitely need this!
04/09/2022,Ryan Buckley,For real guys... get this done. Been using Webflow for one day and I already need this.
15/07/2022,Jori Van Keulen,Yes much needed
12/05/2022,John Siciliano,Yes please. Check out how Duda implmenets this. They basically allow double brackets "{{" and it pulls up a UI that lets you choose the CMS item to insert. Thanks guys.
08/03/2022,Per-Erik Ingjer,Agreed. For SEO purposes I need a H1 like "[Text from CMS] + static text" like mentioned below.
04/02/2022,Josh Arras,Really need this feature. Is this something that is being considered or should we just assume it won't be added at this point?
20/12/2021,Thomas Busson,Upvote - Use case: "[Text from CMS] + static text"
02/12/2021,Kyle Schmitz,Upvoted.
09/11/2021,SH,3years and a half... i think it's time to give up on Webflow. Other companies are putting rockets into orbit faster than you do basic stuff like this.
09/11/2021,SH,The worst thing about this is that if you have a static text and a cms text in the same heading webflow will create 2-3 different headings which will kill your SEO. I dont understand why this is not built in already.
30/03/2021,Dave Foy,Meant to say: while it would be ideal to simply highlight a portion of text in a headline (for example) and make it dynamic I'm reminded of how Elementor (a WordPress page builder plugin) handles creating smaller pieces of dynamic text.
29/03/2021,Dave Foy,I'm constantly telling everyone how amazing the CMS is (and it is!). But I've just hit this need to be able to display dynamic CMS data inline a really simple use case. I can't quite believe it's not possible without setting multiple list items to display inline.
04/12/2020,Pierre,Needed please!! üôè
16/10/2020,Vianney Percq,Needed please.
11/04/2020,Djoe,This is very much needed and easy to implement.
22/07/2019,Marc Jeschke,Absolutely great idea I¬¥m struggling with the same problem...
24/06/2019,Stu Goymer,Oh man this is SO needed now!
17/06/2019,Sebastian Zimmer,Nedded!
