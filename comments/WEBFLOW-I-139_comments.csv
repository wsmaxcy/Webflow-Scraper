04/06/2023,Sibylle,Guys having the Editor interface that the client interacts with in English only is really a bit of a show stopper in countries where the local language is not English. Especially small business owners may not feel very comfortable in English.
22/05/2023,Michael Nöthiger,Guys this is a must for an international Corporation like you are! America is not the world …
04/05/2023,Ludovic Annes,This is really a must-have feature that's the only thing preventing us from switching to Webflow (we are a French based agency). How can we give control to our customers if the interface is not in their language. Please take time to localize your content and think about the 75% of us in the world who do not speak native English.
26/04/2023,Mike,Really important for our international team! Japanese Chinese Spanish especially.
20/02/2023,Roman Chappuis,I'm in Switzerland and it would be great if at least the editor could be in french and german. I would love to switch to webflow but for now i have to stick with wordpress because of this issue
01/02/2023,Christian Sager,My customer will not accept a website that can  only be created knowing English because he needs to update it with his own personel. Webflow ist therefore out.
11/01/2023,Jerome,I would like to be able to deliver a site to my French customers without having to explain each term to them. Please do a backoffice translation
02/09/2022,Alice Holm,I most likely have to switch to Wix editor x because of this issue.. They even have an option to select Monday as the first day of the week and use 24h clock on CMS date fields. I'm Norwegian with Norwegian clients and not all can understand English. Especially older people.
30/07/2022,Armand Meunier,It's difficult to sell webflow to clients when the CMS is not in their own language. The language barrier prevents them to reasonably use webflow in their every day work because they don't project themselves using this tool. It's an important feature if webflow wants to gain a substainable ground outside non English speaking countries against more traditional CMS. I also believe that the number of votes for this subject is not representative of its importance because the lacking of this feature is sufficient to discourage anyone who gives importance to client experience.
28/07/2022,[ j. bilhan ],Such an important feature. First time I’ve ever pitched a web project to a non-native English client and while demonstrating the CMS I realized their team may not be able to use it.
27/06/2022,Aramas Marketing,THIS IS IMPORTANT!
22/06/2022,Heinrich,This feature missing is seriously harming my business as older or more conservative clients don't wan't to work with an english editor. I would need German.
13/04/2022,Ayla Hourani,Is this still not a thing?
03/02/2022,Masaki Mori,I'm a Japanese who loves Webflow. Believing in the possibility of no-code I started using Webflow a few years ago.
01/02/2022,Matthew Wallace,WTF why is this not a thing
30/06/2021,Creative Effects TV,The truth is I am disappointed in the wefblow program the dumbest thing I have put the idea since 2018 to place the multi-language in the interface and it has not put it but one day I talked to the support he told me that multi-language arrived for the year 2019 or 2020 I do not know but If we are in 2021 the truth is if it is more gross I have seen another program that is similar webflow already has a Spanish language but the only webflow that does not give Spanish language for the interface which is disappointing that is why I do not want to use this program until it is in Spanish until when you will last but we have spent almost three years no news. I hope it can get there is something important for one to understand what it means because we need to understand everything in Spanish thanks
21/06/2021,Max Dinser,I could use German language in Editor would be happy to translate label files
08/06/2021,Ray Hood,I think this is an easy to implement and very useful function. As Webflow gains acceptance around the world it would only be logical that clients can upload CMS content using an GUI in their language. I'm sure the community would help with the translations. It would be a win win for Webflow and users.
27/01/2021,Mario Muther,
29/09/2020,YourLabs Business Service,Maybe let users contribute translations ? Even in .po files or something it'd definitely work for everybody and users would be able to share community files and fork it out for their own project.Keep up the great work Webflow !
