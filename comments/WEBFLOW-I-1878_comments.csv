17/05/2021,Irina Pistsov,Was there any updates to that? The phone number is still not included in the order details email
09/04/2021,Cassie Bone,Not only can we not customise the email body of customers notifications but without having the customers email address in the body of the email that we receive we can't even set up Zaps to arrange an email to be sent to the client with the information that we should be able to add into the Webflow email.
11/05/2020,Adam Johannes,This is really urgent for me as I need to forward the order onto the fulfilment people who don't want to login and search around webflow for it they need the information from me. I cannot do it easily as I have to log into the editor then go back and amend the order email... This is hard on desktop but ideally I'd want to do it on my phone but that's even harder...
05/06/2019,Dennis Winter,Yea this is quite a hassle. My customer cant work off the emails he receives since the emails address is only viewable when logged in viewing the orders.
