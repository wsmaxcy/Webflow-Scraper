30/05/2023,Patrick Moors,Really want this! FinSweets solution is great but trying to combine that solution with other tabs-related custom code is a pain for people like who don't know js
29/06/2021,Zacchino,Indeed this seems like a good temporary workaround but needless to say: Webflow users will get pretty tired of paying small monthly fees here and there just for a feature that could've been native.
29/06/2021,Webflow Admin,Thank you for your idea!
23/07/2020,Team Us_Berlin,If tabs could have CMS integration they could improve the filtering experience of any sections and could avoid loading another page when a filter is applied. I would also recommend adding some type of burger menu for tablet/mobile where all the filters would be stacked like in a top navigation.Thanks
27/11/2018,Jen Armstrong,Yes I'd like for tabs to be able to automatically populate. My current project that led me to search for this is an employee list you click on an employee and the corresponding info appears below. I know I can set this up manually but really need this automated within the CMS.
