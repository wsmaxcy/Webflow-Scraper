27/02/2023,Denis Timoshenko,I need this lottie to work inside a collection list!!!!!!!!!!!!!
07/04/2022,Luis Mora,It would be awesome to have this feature ASAP. Thanks Webflow!
04/04/2022,Guest,Access your Webflow project in the Designer. Click the Assets icon or press J on your keyboard to open the Assets panel. Click the Upload button and select your After Effects animation or drag your After Effects JSON file into the Assets panel. Drag your animation into the canvas of your project.
09/02/2022,Jon Burdon,This is an essential feature - Webflow makes a big deal about Lottie integration and most sites end up needing a simple CMS. This is a really important update
07/01/2022,Colin Chaloner,Oh man. I've only just realised today this isn't possible. Would be amazing if this could be implemented. I need to generate a random lottie from a set each time the page refreshes and as great as Julian Wan's workaround is I don't think it would work in this instance. Would be so great if Lottie's just worked with Collections the way images and videos do!
