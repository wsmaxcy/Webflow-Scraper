10/05/2023,Aimeric Marchau,I'm really commited to make sustainable web design as the main topic when creating websites so this is more than necessary to have this ability!
29/01/2023,Joseph Laurence,We definitely need this for regulatory reasons.
19/11/2021,Marcus Devaney,With the introduction of Memberships and Logic we are now considering using Webflow to expand software business to deliver user enhanced websites.  However as we work exlcusively in the UK market and with Health clients we NEED this implemented as its a base requirment of many who work within/with the NHS.

21/10/2020,Jana,Yes very important! I have several clients in Europe and especially with the privacy shield solution we need a better way to confirm with GDPR. Webflow needs to offer hosting in different countries and regions!!
28/09/2020,Eva,Very important! Many Canadian clients insist on Canadian hosting due to privacy laws.
11/08/2020,Lift Interactive,This is important for us in Canada as well.
03/04/2020,Chris Lacey,Definitely required - I am losing clients who need to host within the UK for GDPR reasons.
15/02/2020,Xuehui Zhang,Important!
04/02/2020,Udo Bernstein,The same here: two major clients will not let me use Webflow for any web projects here in Germany. When they hear 'hosted in the USA' they get paranoid instantly. Please offer me a waterproof solution to calm those down.
20/01/2020,Athlon London,Important
16/12/2019,T B,Ability to host the CMS on any server would be even better then I could finally stop creating Wordpress sites. I do the design in Webflow and then I convert it to Wordpress because Wordpress has one single important feature that webflow dont: My clients can use their own local host and thats always a must for my clients here in 2019/2020
20/11/2019,Guest,This is good step taken by authorities to filter the websites. It is complex to read and monitor big amount of data but by taking this measure we will be able to control majority of them. If you are facingÂ windows dll issue then kick it away by simply reading the tips.
16/08/2019,Harish Venkatesh,Is there an update on this in 2019.
09/08/2019,Joe Pacal,Much agreed especially in the wake of GDPR in EU very important.
04/10/2018,Robert Cat,Any updates?
01/03/2018,Benjamin Gabay,Yes... especially with DPRG coming.... In europe people want a hosting in europe. :/
01/03/2018,Victor Leboda,Very important for us
11/01/2018,Sturm Bernhard,Very important point here in Switzerland as well...
18/01/2017,Tobias Heilmann-Schuricht,This is becoming increasingly significant!
