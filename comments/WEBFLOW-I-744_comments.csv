18/05/2021,Nicholas William,iOS11 update is good enough to use but after that they improve things in many ways. The https://bmmagazine.co.uk/in-business/a-look-at-how-online-essay-writing-services-can-benefit-you/ share some good points and updates news too.
18/05/2018,Troy Jacobs,The problem is they keep merging the wrong requests together. There’s 2: 1 for cms changes and one for a designer app (or at the very least being able to use the web app designer on an iPad).
03/05/2018,Patrick Burnett,Putting in my vote to be able to work in Webflow on my iPad Pro!
22/08/2017,Filip Sipos,It is perfectly functional on the iPad 12.3 even the UI is just fine even with fingers! With the keyboard and mouse or pen it’s even better...I can already do everything just fine but save...why webflow - if we request desktop version it works on all android devices so why not allow it on iPad too?? Just give us a pop up message that it is not designed for touch device if you must but let us save the work.....you don’t even have to develope anything new just remove the bit of a code that prevents us from saving the work! PLEASE
22/06/2017,Filip Sipos,yes there is absolutely no reason why we can use webflow on the new iPads especially the 12.9. We don't need touch support and we don't care that the UI size is relatively small for touch apple pencil or any Bluetooth mouse works on iPad same way it does on desktop!
17/06/2017,Johnny Liabø,With the new drag and drop feature in iOS 11 Webflow Designer could finally be working on the tablet. Please look into this Webflow as there seem to be lots og people wanting to work from their iPads! Having tried the iPad in Webflow Designer (unfortunately in Read-only mode because it's not supported) I realize drag and drop is all you need!
