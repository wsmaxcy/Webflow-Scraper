15/02/2023,Stephen,yes we really need this feature.
08/02/2023,Shawn Shahin,Huge need now. Webflow would be smart to find a way for us to be able to index so it internally can match the way rankmath does it for wordpress.
02/01/2023,Darren Matthews,I would certainly like to see this happen. It is something everyone could benefit from.
26/09/2022,Joe Bates,IMHO it would seem like a simple thing for them to add some backend code that would upload the entered key to the root directory. That verification key could be entered into a new insertion line on the SEO tab for a given site.  If they wanted to go the extra mile they could have an additional line for URL submission and a button to push to activate an updated indexing.
24/05/2022,Alexander Alten,Its now 3 month and no response. What is so hard to add this into the project settings @webflow?
12/04/2022,Bas Jansse,Definitely a big win if this would be possible. It is becoming the standard so it would make sense and would be very appreciated if Webflow would make this a priority!
